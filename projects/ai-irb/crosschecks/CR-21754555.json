If governance decisions are being made during the cold window, there is a gap in coverage that should be documented.\n- **Ops-scripts surface:** Changes to ops-scripts can have cascading effects if they are referenced by CI/CD pipelines or automated runbooks. Need confirmation this is additive, not mutative of existing scripts.\n- **Recurring execution risk:** Hourly cadence means 24 invocations/day. Even low-risk operations can compound — confirm idempotency and that no state drift occurs across invocations.\n- **Observability:** No mention of logging, alerting, or success/failure reporting for the warm-up cycle.\n- **Governance self-reference:** A governance engine testing itself introduces a mild circularity concern — who governs the governance warm-up? Confirm there is an independent check.\n\n---\n\n## 3) REQUIRED_GATES:\n\n- **Idempotency verification:** Evidence that repeated hourly execution produces no state drift, resource leakage, or cumulative side effects.\n- **Scope documentation:** Clear specification of what the warm-up executes — which governance checks, against what inputs, with what expected outputs.\n- **Dry-run evidence:** At least 24-hour (24-cycle) dry-run log demonstrating stable, predictable behavior with no anomalies.\n- **Observability confirmation:** Logging and alerting must be in place for warm-up failures; failed governance warm-ups should surface to on-call, not fail silently.\n- **Blast radius confirmation:** Written attestation that the warm-up path is read-only / side-effect-free with respect to production governance decisions (i.e., warm-up cannot accidentally approve, reject, or modify real policy).\n- **Independent validation:** Confirmation that an independent mechanism (outside the governance engine itself) validates warm-up success/failure.\n- **Rollback path:** Documented procedure to disable the hourly cadence without requiring a deploy.\n\n---\n\n## 4) RECOMMENDATION: **REQUEST_CHANGES**\n\n**Rationale:** The change is conceptually low-risk and operationally sound in intent — keeping a governance engine warm is good hygiene. However, the proposal as submitted lacks sufficient specificity on scope, observability, and blast-radius isolation. The primary concern is not that this is dangerous, but that it is *under-specified* for a surface labeled \"governance.\" Changes to governance infrastructure warrant a higher documentation bar than typical ops-scripts changes, precisely because governance is a trust-critical system.\n\n**Path to APPROVE:** Provide the required gates above — particularly the dry-run evidence, blast-radius attestation, and observability confirmation — and this should clear without further review.",
