      "summary": "1) RISK: **MEDIUM**\n\n2) CONCERNS:\n*   **Data Contamination (Model Collapse):** There is a risk that \"dogfood\" inputs/outputs generated during the warm-up cycle will be ingested into production logs and subsequently used for future model fine-tuning. This could lead to feedback loops or training on synthetic data.\n*   **Operational Noise (Alert Fatigue):** If the governance engine is being \"warmed up\" by testing edge cases or policy violations, there is a high risk of triggering false positive security alerts to the on-call team every hour.\n*   **Resource Contention:** Hourly execution of the full governance stack could introduce latency spikes or resource locking that affects concurrent production traffic.\n*   **Failure Modes:** It is unclear if a failure in the warm-up script (e.g., a hang or crash) results in a \"fail-open\" (governance disabled) or \"fail-closed\" (production traffic blocked) state.\n\n3) REQUIRED_GATES:\n*   **Data Segregation Verification:** Evidence that all logs, metrics, and data artifacts generated by the `ops-scripts` are explicitly tagged (e.g., `is_synthetic=true`, `env=dogfood`) and strictly excluded from training pipelines and customer analytics.\n*   **Alert Suppression Validation:** A test run demonstrating that policy violations triggered by the warm-up script are routed to a null sink or a specific testing dashboard, rather than production security queues/pagers.\n*   **Latency Impact Report:** Comparison of production latency (p99) during the warm-up window versus baseline.\n*   **Fail-Safe Demonstration:** A test case showing that if the warm-up script crashes or times out, the governance engine remains operational for external user traffic.\n\n4) RECOMMENDATION: **REQUEST_CHANGES**\n\n*Rationale: While warming up the engine is operationally sound, automating interactions with the Governance layer requires strict proof that test data will not poison the training pool and that test alerts will not burden human reviewers. The current summary does not detail these isolation mechanisms.*",
