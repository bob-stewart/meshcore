      "summary": "1) **RISK: MEDIUM**\n\n2) **CONCERNS:**\n*   **Resource Contention:** \"Warm-up\" implies loading models or caches. Doing this hourly on the production governance engine risks creating latency spikes or resource contention (CPU/GPU/Memory) for live user traffic during the execution window.\n*   **Audit Log Pollution:** High-frequency dogfooding (hourly) may flood safety and audit logs with synthetic data, making it difficult to detect genuine adversarial attacks or governance failures.\n*   **State Mutation Risk:** If the \"warm-up\" involves more than just read operations (e.g., updating dynamic blocklists or calibration stats), a bug in the `ops-script` could corrupt the active governance state.\n*   **Failure Mode Behavior:** It is unclear how the system behaves if the warm-up script fails or hangs. Does it fail open (bypassing governance) or fail closed (causing a DoS)?\n*   **Opaque Evidence:** Evidence ID `20260217T081956Z` is cited, but no summary of the test results, latency impact, or resource consumption metrics was provided in the description.\n\n3) **REQUIRED_GATES:**\n*   **Non-Interference Proof:** Telemetry data from a staging environment showing that the warm-up script does not increase P99 latency for concurrent user requests.\n*   **Synthetic Tagging:** Confirmation that all requests generated by this script are tagged (e.g., `is_synthetic=true` or specific headers) to ensure they are excluded from production safety analytics and model retraining datasets.\n*   **Read-Only Verification:** Code review confirmation that the script executes strictly read-only operations against the governance policies and does not possess write/admin privileges.\n*   **Timeout/Circuit Breaker:** Evidence of hard timeouts implemented in the script to prevent \"stacking\" (multiple hourly instances running simultaneously if one hangs).\n\n4) **RECOMMENDATION: REQUEST_CHANGES**\n\n**Reasoning:** While warming up the governance engine is a valid operational goal to reduce cold-start latency, automating this on an hourly basis against the critical safety layer requires proof of isolation. We cannot approve until we verify that the script cannot degrade live performance or pollute the audit trails used for safety monitoring. Please provide the specific metrics from Evidence `20260217T081956Z` regarding latency impact.",
