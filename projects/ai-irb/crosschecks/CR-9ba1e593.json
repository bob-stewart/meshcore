      "summary": "1) **RISK: MEDIUM**\n\n2) **CONCERNS:**\n*   **Audit Log Pollution:** \"Warming up\" a governance engine implies sending synthetic or replayed requests. If these are not strictly segregated from production traffic logs, it compromises the defensibility and accuracy of our safety reporting.\n*   **Resource Contention:** Running a scheduled script hourly against the governance engine introduces a risk of latency spikes or resource exhaustion (CPU/Memory) that could delay or timeout actual safety checks on live user traffic.\n*   **Unintended Side Effects:** If the warm-up routine triggers actual enforcement logic (e.g., flagging content, banning users, sending alerts to on-call), it creates operational noise and potential false positives.\n*   **State Corruption:** There is a risk that the \"dogfood\" script might alter the state of the governance cache or database, potentially causing race conditions with live data.\n\n3) **REQUIRED_GATES:**\n*   **Data Isolation Proof:** Evidence that all telemetry, logs, and enforcement actions generated by this script are tagged (e.g., `is_synthetic=true` or `source=dogfood`) and excluded from production safety metrics.\n*   **No-Op Verification:** Confirmation that the warm-up requests run in \"dry-run\" mode or against a non-enforcing endpoint to prevent actual account actions or downstream API calls.\n*   **Load Impact Analysis:** A performance test showing that the hourly execution does not degrade P99 latency for concurrent live governance requests.\n*   **Failure Mode Safety:** Verification that if the ops-script hangs or crashes, it does not lock the governance engine or block the processing queue.\n\n4) **RECOMMENDATION: REQUEST_CHANGES**\n*   *Reasoning:* While keeping the engine warm is operationally sound to prevent cold-start latency, the potential for polluting safety logs or triggering false enforcement actions is too high without explicit evidence of isolation and dry-run enforcement.
