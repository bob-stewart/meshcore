      "summary": "1) **RISK: MEDIUM**\n\n2) **CONCERNS:**\n*   **Audit Log Pollution:** Automated \"dogfood\" traffic mixed with production governance logs can compromise compliance audits if not strictly segregated or clearly tagged.\n*   **State Mutation Risks:** The term \"warm-up\" is ambiguous. If the script executes write operations (e.g., creating dummy policies or enforcing rules) rather than just read/query operations to prime caches, it risks altering the production security posture.\n*   **Alert Fatigue:** If the hourly script fails (due to transient network issues), it may trigger high-severity alerts for the on-call team regarding \"Governance Engine Failure,\" leading to desensitization.\n*   **Resource Contention:** Running hourly scripts against the governance engine could introduce latency for legitimate policy evaluations if the warm-up is resource-intensive.\n\n3) **REQUIRED_GATES:**\n*   **Read-Only Verification:** Static analysis or code review evidence confirming the script performs strictly `READ` or `DRY-RUN` operations, with no ability to modify governance rules or access control lists (ACLs).\n*   **Synthetic User/Tagging:** Evidence that all actions generated by this script are tagged with a distinct identifier (e.g., `source: internal-dogfood` or `user: synthetic-monitor`) to allow for easy filtering in audit logs.\n*   **Failure Mode Analysis:** Documentation defining what happens if the warm-up fails. It must fail closed (log an error) rather than failing open (disabling governance) or triggering P0 incidents.\n*   **Staging Replay:** A successful run log (referencing Evidence ID 20260219T151955Z) specifically showing that the script ran without triggering downstream enforcement actions (e.g., no emails sent, no tickets created).\n\n4) **RECOMMENDATION: REQUEST_CHANGES**\n\n*Reasoning: While keeping the governance engine warm is valid for performance, interacting with the `governance` surface via `ops-scripts` requires strict proof of isolation. We cannot approve until we verify that this automation will not corrupt the audit trail or accidentally enforce dummy policies in production.*",
