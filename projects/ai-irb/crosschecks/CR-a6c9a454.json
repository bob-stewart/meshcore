      "stance": "request_changes",
      "summary": "1) RISK: **MEDIUM**\n\n2) CONCERNS:\n*   **Operational Interference:** Running a script hourly against the governance engine creates a risk of resource contention (CPU/Memory/Locking) that could increase latency for legitimate, real-time safety checks.\n*   **Audit Log Pollution:** \"Dogfood\" traffic mixed with production governance logs can compromise the defensibility of audit trails. If the system cannot distinguish between a \"warm-up\" check and a real policy violation, compliance reporting becomes unreliable.\n*   **Unintended Side Effects:** If the \"warm-up\" involves executing policy logic, there is a risk of triggering actual enforcement actions (e.g., account suspensions, data flagging) against internal accounts or test data, potentially causing internal outages.\n*   **Cache Poisoning:** If the warm-up script loads incorrect or stale configurations into the governance cache, it could degrade the accuracy of safety decisions for subsequent real traffic.\n\n3) REQUIRED_GATES:\n*   **Read-Only Verification:** Static analysis or code review confirmation that the script performs strictly read-only operations and cannot mutate policy state or enforcement records.\n*   **Telemetry Separation:** Evidence that logs generated by this script are tagged (e.g., `source: synthetic-dogfood`) and filtered out of standard compliance/safety dashboards.\n*   **Resource Profiling:** Performance data (referenced by Evidence ID) showing the script's execution footprint is negligible (<1-2% overhead) and includes a hard timeout to prevent hanging processes.\n*   **Failure Mode Analysis:** Documentation of what happens if the warm-up fails. Does it fail open (allowing traffic) or fail closed (blocking traffic)? It must not degrade the availability of the governance engine.\n\n4) RECOMMENDATION: **REQUEST_CHANGES**\n\n*Rationale: While warming up the engine is a valid operational goal, modifying the governance surface requires strict proof that the automation will not introduce noise into audit logs or contend with live safety enforcement. The provided Evidence ID is insufficient without a summary of the resource impact and log separation strategy.*",
