      "summary": "1) RISK: **MEDIUM**\n\n2) CONCERNS:\n*   **Audit Log Pollution:** High-frequency (hourly) synthetic traffic may obscure genuine security incidents or governance violations in audit logs, making forensic analysis difficult.\n*   **State Integrity:** There is a risk that the \"warm-up\" routine could inadvertently modify governance policies, quotas, or state, rather than simply querying them to keep caches hot.\n*   **Resource Contention:** If the governance engine is under load, an automated hourly script could introduce latency for legitimate inference requests or block critical safety checks.\n*   **Privilege Scope:** The script requires access to the governance layer. If the script's credentials are over-privileged (e.g., write access), it represents a significant internal attack vector.\n\n3) REQUIRED_GATES:\n*   **Telemetry Tagging:** Evidence that all logs and metrics generated by this script are explicitly tagged (e.g., `source:synthetic` or `traffic_type:dogfood`) to allow for easy filtering in security dashboards.\n*   **Least Privilege Verification:** Proof that the service account executing the script has strictly **Read-Only** permissions on governance policies and cannot alter configurations.\n*   **Non-Blocking Execution:** Performance test results showing that the script executes asynchronously and yields priority to live traffic (QoS checks).\n*   **Failure Mode Analysis:** Documentation confirming that if the warm-up script crashes or hangs, it fails closed without impacting the availability of the governance engine.\n\n4) RECOMMENDATION: **REQUEST_CHANGES**\n\n*Reasoning: While keeping the governance engine warm is operationally sound, interacting with the safety layer requires strict isolation guarantees. We need explicit confirmation that this script cannot write to the governance state and that its logs are distinct from actual user activity before approval.*",
