      "summary": "1) RISK: **MEDIUM**\n\n2) CONCERNS:\n*   **Audit Log Pollution:** There is a significant risk that hourly dogfooding events will mix with production telemetry. This complicates incident forensics and compliance auditing if the test traffic is not strictly segregated or tagged.\n*   **Resource Contention:** \"Warm-up\" implies triggering the engine to keep caches hot. If this script executes during peak load, it may compete for compute resources with live user traffic, potentially increasing latency for safety checks.\n*   **Data Contamination (Learning Loops):** If the governance engine utilizes any form of online learning or feedback loops to update its policy enforcement, repetitive \"warm-up\" data could bias the model or desensitize it to specific patterns.\n*   **Alert Fatigue:** If the dogfood script fails (e.g., due to a network blip), it must not trigger high-severity pager alerts for the on-call team unless the governance engine itself is down.\n*   **Privilege Escalation:** The `ops-script` requires permissions to invoke the governance engine. We must ensure these credentials cannot be exploited to bypass safety filters or exfiltrate policy configurations.\n\n3) REQUIRED_GATES:\n*   **Traffic Tagging Verification:** Evidence that all requests generated by this script contain a distinct header or metadata tag (e.g., `X-Traffic-Type: Synthetic-Warmup`) to ensure exclusion from production analytics and compliance reports.\n*   **Payload Safety Review:** Submission of the exact text/payloads used for the warm-up. These must be static, benign, and clearly identifiable as test data.\n*   **Resource Impact Analysis:** A comparison of governance engine latency (p99) with and without the script running, ensuring <1% degradation.\n*   **Failure Mode Documentation:** A flowchart or code snippet demonstrating that if the script fails, it fails silently or logs a warning, rather than crashing the service or blocking the deployment pipeline.\n*   **Review of Evidence 20260216T181956Z:** The provided evidence ID must be accessible and show a successful dry run where the governance engine correctly identified the traffic as internal/test.\n\n4) RECOMMENDATION: **REQUEST_CHANGES**\n\n*Reasoning: While keeping the governance engine warm is operationally sound, modifying the `governance` surface requires strict isolation guarantees. The current summary does not specify how this traffic is distinguished from real user data, nor does it confirm that the \"dogfood\" data won't negatively impact safety auditing. These isolation mechanisms must be defined before approval.*",
