Risk of over-logging or exporting sensitive data to logs/metrics.\n- **Environment boundary confusion:** “dogfood” scheduled in a way that might leak into production tenants or production governance state.\n- **Observability gaps:** Without explicit success criteria and metrics, difficult to tell whether warm-up helps or harms.\n\n3) **REQUIRED_GATES:**\n- **Design/intent clarification doc** (1–2 pages): exact warm-up actions, read/write behavior, scope, permissions, and how it differs from normal request paths.\n- **Least-privilege review**: service account permissions explicitly enumerated; confirm no write/admin capabilities unless strictly required; approval from security/governance owner.\n- **Idempotency + “read-only” guarantees**: tests or code-level assertions that warm-up cannot mutate policy state, enforcement state, or user data.\n- **Load/perf testing evidence**: before/after measurements for CPU, memory, QPS, latency, and downstream dependencies; include worst-case policy set size.\n- **Staged rollout plan**: canary to a small subset (single region/cluster/tenant), then gradual expansion; documented rollback.\n- **Rate limiting + jitter**: ensure hourly jobs are randomized and bounded; protect downstream systems; retry policy with backoff and max attempts.\n- **Monitoring + alerting**: explicit SLOs and dashboards (success rate, duration, error classes, resource usage, downstream error rates); paging thresholds to avoid alert storms.\n- **Audit/logging review**: confirm logs don’t include sensitive policy contents or identifiers beyond what’s approved; retention/visibility checked.\n- **Operational runbook**: how to disable quickly (feature flag/kill switch), manual run procedure, ownership/on-call, and incident response steps.\n- **Safety kill switch validated**: demonstrate ability to disable within minutes without redeploy.\n- **Change management**: code review sign-off by governance owner + ops owner; confirm aligns with governance compliance requirements.\n\n4) **RECOMMENDATION: REQUEST_CHANGES**",

      "summary": "1) RISK: **MEDIUM**\n\n2) CONCERNS:\n*   **State Mutation Risk:** The term \"warm-up\" implies a read-only or cache-loading operation, but \"dogfooding\" often involves end-to-end execution. If the governance engine takes automated enforcement actions (e.g., banning users, locking resources, updating policy versions) during this hourly run, there is a risk of accidental internal denial-of-service or configuration corruption.\n*   **Audit Log Pollution:** High-frequency (hourly) synthetic runs against the governance engine may flood compliance logs, making it difficult to isolate genuine security incidents or policy violations.\n*   **Resource Contention:** Running a full governance stack hourly could introduce latency or resource starvation for production traffic if not properly isolated or throttled.\n*   **Privilege Scope:** The script likely requires elevated privileges to interact with the governance layer. If the script is compromised or buggy, it represents a recurring attack vector.\n\n3) REQUIRED_GATES:\n*   **Idempotency Verification:** Evidence that the script is strictly read-only or idempotent (i.e., running it multiple times does not alter the state of the governance ruleset).\n*   **Traffic Segregation:** Proof that \"dogfood\" traffic is tagged (e.g., `is_synthetic=true`) to ensure it is excluded from production compliance metrics and audit alerts.\n*   **Failure Mode Analysis:** Documentation on what happens if the warm-up script hangs or fails. Does it fail open (disabling governance) or fail closed (blocking ops)?\n*   **Resource Profiling:** Evidence (graphs/logs) from a staging run showing CPU/memory impact during the warm-up cycle.\n*   **Review of Evidence 20260218T231955Z:** The provided evidence ID must be linked to a dry-run log showing exactly what API calls are made during the warm-up.\n\n4) RECOMMENDATION: **REQUEST_CHANGES**\n\n*Reasoning: While keeping the governance engine warm is a valid operational goal, automating interactions with the safety control plane requires proof of isolation. We need explicit confirmation that this script cannot mutate governance policies or trigger false-positive enforcement actions before approval.*",
