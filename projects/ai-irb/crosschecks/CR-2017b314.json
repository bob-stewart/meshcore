Each has different failure-mode profiles.\n- **Governance engine self-reference:** A governance engine warming itself up introduces a mild bootstrapping concern — if the warm-up path bypasses or short-circuits any governance checks, it could create an unaudited execution window.\n- **Ops-scripts surface:** Changes to ops-scripts can have lateral blast radius if they modify shared utilities, environment variables, or authentication contexts used by other operational tooling.\n- **Resource consumption:** \"Hourly\" cadence on warm-up implies recurring compute/network cost; need confirmation this doesn't degrade availability for production governance evaluations.\n- **Observability:** No mention of logging, alerting, or metrics for warm-up success/failure — silent failures in governance infrastructure are particularly dangerous.\n- **Evidence sufficiency:** Single evidence ID provided; unclear if this includes test results, dry-run logs, or only a design document.\n\n---\n\n## 3) REQUIRED_GATES:\n\n- **Dry-run evidence:** Provide logs from at least one full cycle of the warm-up executing in a staging/non-production environment, demonstrating no side effects on governance decision paths.\n- **Idempotency verification:** Confirm that repeated/overlapping warm-up invocations (e.g., if a previous hourly run hasn't completed) do not cause race conditions or state corruption.\n- **Governance bypass audit:** Explicit attestation that the warm-up path does NOT skip, weaken, or stub out any governance policy checks — the engine must not grade its own homework differently during warm-up.\n- **Rollback plan:** Document how to disable or revert the hourly warm-up without a full deployment, e.g., feature flag or cron disable.\n- **Observability confirmation:** Warm-up must emit structured logs and at minimum a success/failure metric that feeds into existing alerting.\n- **Resource impact assessment:** Brief analysis showing the hourly invocation's compute/memory/network footprint is negligible relative to baseline.\n- **Peer review sign-off:** At least one additional engineer review on the ops-scripts diff, given the shared-surface nature.\n\n---\n\n## 4) RECOMMENDATION: **APPROVE**\n\n*Conditioned on the required gates above being satisfied before merge/deploy.* The change is low-risk in nature — warm-up of an existing engine is a standard operational pattern — but governance infrastructure deserves extra diligence precisely because failures there are silent and systemic. The gates above are lightweight and should not meaningfully delay rollout if the work is already well-structured.",
