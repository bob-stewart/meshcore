      "summary": "1) RISK: **MEDIUM**\n\n2) CONCERNS:\n*   **Resource Contention:** Running a governance engine \"warm-up\" hourly could create resource spikes (CPU/Memory) that compete with actual safety checks or policy evaluations, potentially introducing latency in the dogfood environment.\n*   **State/Log Pollution:** If the warm-up involves synthetic transactions, there is a risk of polluting audit logs or governance decision history, making it difficult to distinguish between real compliance failures and test artifacts.\n*   **Environment Leakage:** Ops-scripts often rely on environment variables. There is a risk that a misconfiguration could cause this script to execute against the Production governance engine rather than Dogfood.\n*   **Alert Fatigue:** If the warm-up script fails (e.g., network blip), it may trigger high-severity PagerDuty alerts associated with governance downtime, desensitizing on-call engineers to real incidents.\n\n3) REQUIRED_GATES:\n*   **Environment Isolation Proof:** Static analysis or configuration review confirming the script is hard-coded or strictly scoped to the `dogfood` cluster/endpoint only.\n*   **Read-Only/Idempotency Verification:** Evidence that the \"warm-up\" routine is read-only or, if it writes data, that it uses a specific \"test\" tenant ID that is excluded from compliance reporting.\n*   **Resource Impact Analysis:** A dry-run metric report showing the compute overhead of the warm-up routine relative to the cluster's capacity.\n*   **Observability Separation:** Confirmation that logs/metrics generated by this script are tagged (e.g., `source:synthetic`) to allow filtering in dashboards.\n\n4) RECOMMENDATION: **REQUEST_CHANGES**\n\n*Reasoning: While warming up the engine is a valid operational pattern, modifying the governance surface requires strict defensibility. We need explicit evidence that this script cannot accidentally target production and that it will not degrade the performance of the engine it is trying to maintain.*",
