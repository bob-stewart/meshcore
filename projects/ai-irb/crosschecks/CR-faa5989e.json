      "summary": "1) RISK: **MEDIUM**\n\n2) CONCERNS:\n*   **Audit Log Pollution:** High risk that \"warm-up\" traffic will be indistinguishable from actual governance events, potentially corrupting compliance audits or making forensic investigation difficult.\n*   **Unintended Enforcement:** If the warm-up script utilizes production policy logic, there is a risk of triggering actual enforcement actions (e.g., locking accounts, blocking IPs, revoking tokens) against the test subjects or, worse, bleeding into production contexts.\n*   **Resource Contention:** Hourly execution may coincide with peak traffic, potentially increasing latency for legitimate governance checks (e.g., login authorizations) while the engine processes the warm-up load.\n*   **Alert Fatigue:** If the warm-up triggers policy violation flags, it may flood the Security Operations Center (SOC) with false positives, desensitizing the team to real threats.\n\n3) REQUIRED_GATES:\n*   **Synthetic Traffic Tagging:** Evidence that all requests generated by this script contain specific headers or metadata (e.g., `X-Synthetic-Test: true`) allowing them to be strictly filtered from audit logs and compliance reports.\n*   **No-Op/Read-Only Verification:** Code review or test output proving the script operates in a `dry-run` capacity and possesses no write privileges to the governance state database.\n*   **Latency Impact Analysis:** Performance metrics from a staging environment showing that the warm-up routine does not degrade the P99 latency of concurrent real-time policy evaluations.\n*   **Alert Suppression Confirmation:** Configuration proof that the monitoring system is tuned to ignore violations triggered specifically by the dogfood/warm-up actor ID.\n\n4) RECOMMENDATION: **REQUEST_CHANGES**\n\n*Reasoning: While warming up the engine to prevent cold-start latency is a valid operational goal, automating interactions with the Governance layer requires strict isolation. We cannot approve until there is explicit proof that this traffic will not pollute the audit trail or trigger on-call alerts.*",
