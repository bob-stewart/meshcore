      "summary": "1) **RISK: MEDIUM**\n\n2) **CONCERNS:**\n*   **Audit Trail Pollution:** Governance engines are critical for compliance and safety logging. Running hourly \"dogfood\" tests risks polluting the audit logs with synthetic data, making it difficult to distinguish between real policy violations and warm-up artifacts during a forensic review.\n*   **Alarm Fatigue:** If the warm-up involves triggering policy violations to test the engine, there is a high risk of triggering false positive alerts for the on-call team, leading to desensitization to real safety incidents.\n*   **Resource Contention:** \"Warm-up\" implies loading models or caches. If this script runs hourly, it may contend for resources (GPU/CPU/Memory) needed by the production governance layer during peak times, potentially increasing latency for actual safety checks.\n*   **Privilege Management:** Ops scripts often require elevated privileges to interact with governance layers. There is a concern regarding how credentials are managed for this automated script and whether it adheres to the principle of least privilege.\n\n3) **REQUIRED_GATES:**\n*   **Traffic Tagging Verification:** Evidence that all telemetry, logs, and audit records generated by this script are explicitly tagged (e.g., `source:synthetic` or `is_dogfood:true`) to ensure they can be filtered out of compliance reports.\n*   **Alert Suppression Test:** Demonstration that the specific signals generated by this warm-up do *not* trigger high-severity pages or incident response workflows.\n*   **Resource Impact Analysis:** A comparison of the warm-up load against current production headroom to ensure no latency degradation for user-facing governance checks.\n*   **Read-Only/Idempotency Confirmation:** Confirmation that the \"warm-up\" is strictly read-only or idempotent (cache hydration) and does not alter persistent policy definitions or user reputation scores.\n\n4) **RECOMMENDATION: REQUEST_CHANGES**\n\n*Reasoning: While maintaining a warm cache for the governance engine is a valid operational goal, interacting with the safety layer requires strict isolation of data and alerts. The current summary does not provide sufficient detail on how the \"dogfood\" data is segregated from production compliance data.*",
