      "summary": "1) RISK: **MEDIUM**\n\n2) CONCERNS:\n*   **Resource Contention:** \"Warming up\" a governance engine implies generating load. If the dogfood environment shares underlying infrastructure (compute, database, API quotas) with Production, this hourly spike could degrade the performance of actual safety enforcement.\n*   **Alert Fatigue:** Governance engines typically emit alerts upon policy violations or system errors. An hourly automated run carries a high risk of generating \"noise\" (false positives), desensitizing on-call responders to genuine governance failures.\n*   **Audit Log Pollution:** High-frequency automated runs may flood audit logs, making it difficult to trace genuine human actions or security incidents within the governance history.\n*   **Configuration Drift:** If the \"warm-up\" script modifies state to test the engine, there is a risk it leaves the environment in a non-deterministic state for subsequent users.\n\n3) REQUIRED_GATES:\n*   **Environment Isolation Proof:** Evidence that the `ops-scripts` are hard-coded or strictly scoped to the Dogfood environment ID and cannot accept a Production environment ID as a variable.\n*   **Resource Impact Analysis:** Telemetry data from a dry run showing CPU/Memory/IOPS usage does not exceed 10% of available headroom to prevent \"noisy neighbor\" issues with Prod.\n*   **Alert Routing Verification:** Confirmation that all logs and alerts generated by this specific cron job are routed to a dedicated testing channel or suppressed, ensuring they do not trigger PagerDuty/On-Call flows.\n*   **Idempotency Check:** Verification that the warm-up routine cleans up after itself and does not result in cumulative database growth or state changes over 24 hours.\n\n4) RECOMMENDATION: **REQUEST_CHANGES**\n\n*Rationale: While dogfooding is standard practice, automating load on the Governance surface requires explicit safeguards against resource starvation and alert fatigue which are not detailed in the summary. Approval is contingent on the Alert Routing and Resource Impact evidence.*",
