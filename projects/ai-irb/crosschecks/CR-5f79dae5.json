      "summary": "1) RISK: **MEDIUM**\n\n2) CONCERNS:\n*   **Audit Trail Contamination:** The primary function of a governance engine is to provide a defensible, immutable record of policy enforcement. Injecting hourly \"dogfood\" or \"warm-up\" data into production logs risks polluting compliance evidence unless strictly segregated.\n*   **Alert Fatigue:** If the warm-up routine triggers policy violations (intentionally or accidentally), it may generate false positive alerts, desensitizing the security operations center (SOC) or on-call engineers to real governance breaches.\n*   **Resource Contention:** There is a risk that the warm-up script could lock resources or consume rate limits during peak hours, delaying legitimate governance checks.\n*   **Privilege Escalation:** The `ops-script` requires permissions to invoke the governance engine. If this script is compromised, it could be used as a vector to probe the governance engine for bypasses or to flood the system.\n\n3) REQUIRED_GATES:\n*   **Log Segregation Verification:** Evidence must be provided showing that all telemetry, logs, and audit records generated by this script are explicitly tagged (e.g., `traffic_type: synthetic` or `source: dogfood`) and are excluded from standard compliance reporting views.\n*   **Alert Suppression Test:** A demonstration in the staging environment confirming that \"violations\" triggered by this script do not page on-call staff but are still recorded for system health monitoring.\n*   **Resource Impact Analysis:** Data showing the compute/latency overhead of the warm-up routine is negligible (<1% impact on production latency).\n*   **Identity Scoping:** Confirmation that the service account running this script has \"invoke-only\" permissions and cannot modify governance policies or configurations.\n\n4) RECOMMENDATION: **REQUEST_CHANGES**\n\n**Reasoning:** While keeping the governance engine warm to reduce latency is a valid operational goal, the term \"dogfood\" implies production-tier usage. We cannot approve this until there is explicit proof that this synthetic traffic will not degrade the integrity of our compliance audit trails. Please update the proposal to demonstrate how these logs are isolated from legal hold/audit discovery scopes.",
