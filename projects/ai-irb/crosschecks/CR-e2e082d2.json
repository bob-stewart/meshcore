      "summary": "1) **RISK:** MEDIUM\n\n2) **CONCERNS:**\n*   **Audit Trail Pollution:** Synthetic \"warm-up\" traffic interacting with the governance engine risks corrupting safety logs and compliance metrics if not strictly segregated from production traffic.\n*   **Latency Injection:** The governance engine is a critical path for system safety. An hourly script could introduce resource contention or locking, potentially slowing down real-time safety checks for actual users.\n*   **Privilege Escalation:** Ops scripts interacting with governance layers often require elevated permissions. There is a risk of credential leakage or the script being used as a vector to bypass policy if not properly scoped.\n*   **State Mutation:** It is unclear if the \"warm-up\" is read-only. If the script writes data to keep the cache hot, there is a risk of corrupting the governance state or policy configurations.\n\n3) **REQUIRED_GATES:**\n*   **Traffic Tagging Verification:** Evidence that all requests generated by this script contain specific headers/metadata allowing them to be filtered out of safety audits and performance metrics.\n*   **Non-Interference Test:** Load testing results demonstrating that the script execution does not increase latency for concurrent legitimate governance requests (P99 latency check).\n*   **Least-Privilege Review:** Confirmation that the script utilizes a service account with the minimum necessary permissions (ideally read-only) and does not possess administrative override capabilities.\n*   **Fail-Safe Confirmation:** Documentation showing that if the script hangs or crashes, it does not block or lock the governance engine.\n\n4) **RECOMMENDATION:** REQUEST_CHANGES",
