      "summary": "1) RISK: **MEDIUM**\n\n2) CONCERNS:\n*   **Audit Log Pollution:** The governance engine is a system of record for safety and compliance. Injecting hourly synthetic traffic (\"dogfood\") risks polluting audit trails, making it difficult to distinguish between real policy violations and synthetic tests during a forensic review.\n*   **Alert Fatigue/Operational Noise:** If the governance engine correctly identifies the dogfood traffic as anomalous (or if the warm-up script fails), it may trigger high-severity alerts, desensitizing on-call engineers to genuine safety incidents.\n*   **State Corruption:** \"Warm-up\" implies activity. If this script increments global rate limits, modifies reputation scores, or alters the state of the governance cache, it could negatively impact legitimate production traffic.\n*   **Security Context:** The script requires permissions to invoke the governance engine. If these credentials are over-privileged or mishandled in `ops-scripts`, it introduces a new attack vector.\n\n3) REQUIRED_GATES:\n*   **Synthetic Data Tagging:** Evidence that all logs/telemetry generated by this script are explicitly tagged (e.g., `traffic_type: synthetic` or `source: dogfood`) to ensure they can be filtered out of compliance audits.\n*   **Alert Suppression Verification:** Configuration proof that alerts generated by this specific hourly job are routed to a low-urgency queue and will not page on-call staff.\n*   **Idempotency/Read-Only Confirmation:** Code review or test evidence demonstrating that the warm-up routine does not mutate production state (e.g., it must not consume user rate limit quotas).\n*   **Resource Impact Analysis:** Review of Evidence 20260228T141955Z to confirm that the warm-up routine does not cause latency spikes for concurrent production requests.\n\n4) RECOMMENDATION: **REQUEST_CHANGES**",
