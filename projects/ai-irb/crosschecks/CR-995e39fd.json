      "summary": "1) RISK: **MEDIUM**\n\n2) CONCERNS:\n*   **Audit Log Pollution:** \"Dogfooding\" a governance engine implies sending inputs to test classification/enforcement. If these inputs are not strictly segregated from production traffic, they will corrupt safety metrics and compliance audit trails.\n*   **Alert Fatigue:** If the warm-up involves adversarial or toxic prompts to verify the engine is active, there is a risk of triggering high-priority safety alerts, wasting human reviewer time or desensitizing the SOC (Security Operations Center).\n*   **Resource Contention:** Running hourly scripts against the governance layer could introduce latency for real user requests if the engine is under load, potentially causing a denial-of-service on the safety layer itself.\n*   **Recursion/Looping:** Since this affects `ops-scripts` and `governance`, there is a risk that the governance engine might flag the script's activity, triggering an automated response that triggers the script again.\n\n3) REQUIRED_GATES:\n*   **Telemetry Isolation Plan:** Evidence that all logs generated by this script are tagged (e.g., `source:synthetic` or `env:test`) and excluded from production safety dashboards.\n*   **Payload Disclosure:** A manifest of the specific inputs/prompts used for the \"warm-up.\" If toxic content is used to test the engine, it must be pre-approved.\n*   **Alert Suppression Verification:** Proof that the specific user ID or API key used for this script is whitelisted from triggering P0/P1 human escalation workflows.\n*   **Load Impact Analysis:** Evidence (from staging) that the hourly run does not increase P99 latency for concurrent production requests.\n\n4) RECOMMENDATION: **REQUEST_CHANGES**\n\n*Rationale: While keeping the governance engine warm is operationally sound, modifying the behavior of the safety enforcement layer requires strict proof that test data will not be confused with real threats. The current summary lacks details on how false positives will be prevented.*",
