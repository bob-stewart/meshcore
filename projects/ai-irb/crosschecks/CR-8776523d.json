      "summary": "1) RISK: **MEDIUM**\n\n2) CONCERNS:\n*   **Audit Log Pollution:** High frequency (hourly) synthetic traffic into the governance engine risks diluting genuine safety signals and complicating forensic analysis during incident response.\n*   **Resource Contention:** \"Warm-up\" implies generating load. There is a risk that the script could compete with production traffic for inference or policy-check resources, potentially inducing latency in actual safety enforcement.\n*   **State Mutation:** It is unclear if the \"dogfood\" process is read-only. If the warm-up triggers state changes (e.g., rate limit counters, violation flags), it could inadvertently block legitimate internal users.\n*   **Data Sensitivity:** The specific nature of the \"dogfood\" data is undefined. Using sensitive internal prompts for automated warming in a production environment violates data minimization principles if not strictly necessary.\n\n3) REQUIRED_GATES:\n*   **Traffic Segmentation Plan:** Evidence that all telemetry generated by this script is explicitly tagged (e.g., `is_synthetic=true` or specific `user_agent`) to ensure it can be filtered out of compliance audits and safety metrics.\n*   **Resource Cap Verification:** Test results demonstrating that the script operates within a strict resource quota (CPU/Memory) and has a \"back-off\" mechanism if the governance engine is under high load.\n*   **Idempotency/Read-Only Confirmation:** Code review or test evidence confirming the script does not alter persistent state (e.g., it must not increment violation counters for the accounts used).\n*   **Failure Mode Analysis:** Documentation on behavior if the warm-up fails. It must fail silently without triggering high-severity PagerDuty alerts (alert fatigue risk) or locking down the governance engine.\n\n4) RECOMMENDATION: **REQUEST_CHANGES**\n\n*Rationale: While performance optimization is valid, modifying the `governance` surface requires strict defensibility. We cannot approve until we are certain that this automated traffic will not obscure real safety incidents in our logs or interfere with active policy enforcement.*",
