      "summary": "1) RISK: **MEDIUM**\n\n2) CONCERNS:\n*   **Resource Contention:** Increasing the frequency of governance engine execution to hourly could create a \"noisy neighbor\" effect, potentially starving production resources if the dogfood environment shares underlying infrastructure (compute/database) with production.\n*   **Audit Log Pollution:** \"Warming up\" the engine implies synthetic transactions. There is a risk that these synthetic checks will be indistinguishable from actual policy enforcement events, corrupting compliance audit trails.\n*   **State Locking:** If the warm-up routine involves write operations (e.g., updating cache or state tables), there is a risk of database locking or race conditions that could block legitimate governance checks during the warm-up window.\n*   **Alert Fatigue:** If the warm-up script fails (e.g., due to transient network issues), it may trigger high-severity alerts meant for critical governance failures, desensitizing the on-call team.\n\n3) REQUIRED_GATES:\n*   **Infrastructure Isolation Verification:** Evidence confirming that the dogfood governance instance is logically and physically isolated from the production control plane (i.e., no shared Redis/SQL instances).\n*   **Synthetic Data Tagging:** Demonstration that all telemetry and logs generated by the warm-up script are explicitly tagged (e.g., `is_synthetic: true`) to ensure they can be filtered out of compliance reports.\n*   **Resource Profiling:** A comparison of CPU/Memory usage before and after the change in the test environment to ensure the hourly cadence does not introduce memory leaks or unmanageable spikes.\n*   **Timeout/Circuit Breaker Logic:** Review of the ops-script to ensure it has hard timeouts; the warm-up must fail open and silently rather than hanging the system or retrying indefinitely.\n\n4) RECOMMENDATION: **REQUEST_CHANGES**\n\n*Reasoning: While dogfooding is standard practice, automating high-frequency execution of the governance engine—the primary safety mechanism—requires proof that this automation cannot negatively impact production stability or auditability. The isolation and logging safeguards must be verified before enabling the schedule.*",
