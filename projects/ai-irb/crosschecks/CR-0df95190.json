      "summary": "# AI-IRB Panel Assessment\n\n## SUMMARY REVIEW: Hourly dogfood — governance engine warm-up\n\nThis appears to be a recurring (hourly) operational script that exercises the governance engine to keep it in a \"warm\" state, likely to reduce latency on first real invocations and/or to validate that the governance pipeline is functioning correctly.\n\n---\n\n## 1) RISK: **LOW**\n\nRationale: This is an internal ops-level change affecting infrastructure warm-up routines. It does not alter governance logic, decision boundaries, or user-facing behavior. The blast radius is limited to operational scripts and the governance engine's readiness state.\n\n---\n\n## 2) CONCERNS:\n\n- **Synthetic vs. real traffic ambiguity**: Warm-up invocations must be clearly distinguishable from genuine governance evaluations in logs and audit trails to prevent confusion during incident review or compliance audits.\n- **Resource consumption**: Hourly cadence should be justified; unnecessary warm-ups could consume compute budget or create noise in monitoring/alerting systems.\n- **Silent failure masking**: If the warm-up always uses a trivial/benign payload, it may give false confidence that the governance engine is healthy when it could fail on complex real-world inputs.\n- **Drift risk**: If the warm-up payload is static and never updated, it may not exercise code paths introduced by newer governance rules, reducing its diagnostic value over time.\n- **Single evidence artifact**: Only one evidence ID is provided (20260216T061956Z). Limited evidence makes it harder to assess testing depth and operational validation.\n\n---\n\n## 3) REQUIRED_GATES:\n\n- **Audit trail separation**: Confirm that warm-up invocations are tagged/labeled distinctly (e.g., `source: dogfood-warmup`) so they are excluded from governance decision metrics and audit reports.\n- **Monitoring & alerting validation**: Demonstrate that warm-up failures trigger appropriate ops alerts but do NOT trigger governance-incident escalation paths.\n- **Payload representativeness review**: Provide documentation that the warm-up payload exercises meaningful governance code paths, not just a trivial no-op.\n- **Resource impact assessment**: Evidence that hourly cadence does not materially impact cost, rate limits, or capacity planning (even a brief back-of-envelope calculation suffices).\n- **Rollback plan**: Confirm the warm-up can be disabled quickly (feature flag or cron removal) without side effects if issues arise.\n- **Log review of evidence artifact**: The referenced evidence (20260216T061956Z) should be made available for panel inspection to confirm the change matches the stated summary.\n\n---\n\n## 4) RECOMMENDATION: **APPROVE**\n\nContingent on the required gates above being satisfied prior to production deployment. This is a low-risk operational hygiene measure, but the gates ensure it doesn't introduce audit ambiguity or false-confidence failure modes. No user-facing or policy-altering impact identified.",
