      "summary": "1) RISK: **MEDIUM**\n\n2) CONCERNS:\n*   **Ambiguity of \"Warm-up\" Operations:** It is unclear if the script performs read-only operations (e.g., checking a policy) or write operations (e.g., creating dummy violations). Write operations against the governance engine carry a risk of state corruption or policy drift.\n*   **Metric/Log Pollution:** High-frequency (hourly) testing against the live governance engine risks flooding compliance logs and security dashboards with false positives, potentially masking real incidents (alert fatigue).\n*   **Resource Contention:** Running automated scripts against the governance layer could introduce latency for legitimate user traffic if priority queuing is not correctly configured.\n*   **Failure Modes:** If the \"warm-up\" fails or hangs, there is no documentation on whether this triggers a \"fail-open\" (safety disabled) or \"fail-closed\" (system outage) state for the governance engine.\n*   **Recursive Governance:** If the governance engine is responsible for monitoring `ops-scripts`, there is a risk of a circular dependency or infinite loop where the engine attempts to govern its own warm-up script.\n\n3) REQUIRED_GATES:\n*   **Payload Inspection:** Submission of the exact payloads/prompts used in the warm-up script to ensure they do not contain adversarial content that could inadvertently retrain or confuse the model.\n*   **Data Segregation Plan:** Evidence showing how \"dogfood\" data is tagged (e.g., synthetic headers) and filtered out of production compliance reports and anomaly detection systems.\n*   **Idempotency Verification:** Proof that the script is strictly non-mutating regarding policy definitions and enforcement rules.\n*   **Circuit Breaker Implementation:** A mechanism must be in place to kill the script immediately if governance latency spikes above a defined threshold (e.g., >50ms).\n*   **Alert Suppression/Routing:** Confirmation that events generated by this script are routed to a testing bucket and do not page the on-call security team.\n\n4) RECOMMENDATION: **REQUEST_CHANGES**",
