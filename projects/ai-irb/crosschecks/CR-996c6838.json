      "summary": "1) RISK: **MEDIUM**\n\n2) CONCERNS:\n*   **Operational Side Effects:** \"Warm-up\" implies keeping the system active, but \"dogfooding\" implies using real internal workflows. There is a risk that hourly execution could trigger unintended downstream actions, alert fatigue for security teams, or pollute production audit logs.\n*   **State Modification:** It is unclear if the script is read-only (idempotent) or if it modifies governance policies/configurations to test them. Modifying governance state in production on an hourly basis introduces a high probability of configuration drift or race conditions.\n*   **Failure Modes:** If the governance engine fails during a warm-up cycle, does it fail open (allowing unsafe traffic) or fail closed (blocking legitimate traffic)?\n*   **Resource Consumption:** Hourly execution against the governance engine (which is likely compute-intensive if using LLM-based evaluation) may incur unexpected costs or latency spikes for concurrent user traffic.\n*   **Recursive Loops:** If the governance engine monitors `ops-scripts`, there is a risk of creating a feedback loop where the engine attempts to govern its own warm-up script, potentially locking resources.\n\n3) REQUIRED_GATES:\n*   **Idempotency Verification:** Evidence that the script performs no state changes (writes/updates/deletes) to the governance database or policy store.\n*   **Log/Audit Segregation:** Proof that telemetry generated by this hourly script is tagged (e.g., `is_synthetic: true`) to prevent skewing of compliance reports and safety metrics.\n*   **Load Impact Analysis:** A test run showing CPU/Memory impact on the governance service during the warm-up to ensure it does not degrade performance for live traffic.\n*   **Failure Handling:** Documentation of the script's behavior upon timeout or error (must fail silently without crashing the service or triggering PagerDuty for SecOps).\n*   **Payload Inspection:** Review of the specific prompts/inputs used for the warm-up to ensure they do not contain adversarial content that could trigger actual automated containment protocols.\n\n4) RECOMMENDATION: **REQUEST_CHANGES**\n\n*Reasoning: While warming up the engine is a valid operational goal, automating interactions with the `governance` layer—the system's safety brake—requires strict proof of isolation. We need to verify that this script is purely synthetic and cannot alter safety policies or pollute compliance data.*",
