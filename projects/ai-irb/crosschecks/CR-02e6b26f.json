      "summary": "1) RISK: MEDIUM\n\n2) CONCERNS:\n*   **Production Latency Impact:** \"Warming up\" a governance engine often implies loading heavy policy maps or caches. Doing this hourly could introduce periodic latency spikes or resource contention (CPU/Memory) for live traffic.\n*   **Audit Log Pollution:** Dogfooding the governance engine implies generating synthetic traffic or decisions. If these are not strictly segregated, they will corrupt compliance logs, making it impossible to distinguish between real policy violations and test artifacts.\n*   **Alert Fatigue:** If the dogfooding involves testing policy violations to ensure the engine is working, there is a high risk of triggering false positive alerts to the on-call team.\n*   **Concurrency/Locking:** Risk that the warm-up process might briefly lock shared resources or database tables, causing request timeouts during the initialization window.\n\n3) REQUIRED_GATES:\n*   **Resource Utilization Analysis:** Provide graphs from the staging environment showing CPU/Memory impact during the warm-up phase compared to baseline.\n*   **Data Segregation Plan:** Explicit confirmation that all dogfood telemetry/logs are tagged (e.g., `env=synthetic`) and filtered out of legal/compliance retention buckets.\n*   **Non-Blocking Verification:** Evidence that the script runs asynchronously and that a failure of the script does not crash the main governance service or block user requests (fail-open vs. fail-closed analysis).\n*   **Alert Suppression Test:** Verification that the specific dogfooding signals are routed to a separate notification channel or suppressed to prevent on-call noise.\n\n4) RECOMMENDATION: REQUEST_CHANGES",
