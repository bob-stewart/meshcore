      "summary": "1) **RISK: MEDIUM**\n\n2) **CONCERNS:**\n*   **Audit Trail Pollution:** The Governance Engine is a compliance-critical surface. Injecting hourly \"warm-up\" traffic risks polluting audit logs, making it difficult to distinguish between real policy violations and synthetic keep-alive signals during a forensic review.\n*   **Alert Fatigue:** If the warm-up payload triggers policy violations (intentional or accidental), it may desensitize the on-call team to genuine governance alerts.\n*   **State Contamination:** If the Governance Engine utilizes any adaptive thresholds or anomaly detection (ML-based baselines), feeding it synthetic hourly data may skew the baseline, reducing the efficacy of the engine on real traffic.\n*   **Security Context:** The `ops-scripts` surface implies an automated execution environment. There is a concern regarding how this script authenticates against the Governance Engine and whether it holds privileged access that could be exploited.\n\n3) **REQUIRED_GATES:**\n*   **Synthetic Data Tagging:** Evidence that all warm-up payloads are explicitly tagged (e.g., `traffic_type=synthetic` or `source=warmup`) and that the logging pipeline automatically filters these out of compliance/audit dashboards.\n*   **State Immutability Test:** Verification that the warm-up routine is \"read-only\" regarding the Governance Engine's internal state (i.e., it does not update blocklists, adaptive thresholds, or user reputation scores).\n*   **Payload Review:** Inspection of the specific prompts/data being used for the warm-up to ensure they do not contain adversarial content that might trigger high-priority safety escalations.\n*   **Resource Prioritization:** Confirmation that warm-up requests are deprioritized so they do not degrade latency for actual user traffic during the execution window.\n\n4) **RECOMMENDATION: REQUEST_CHANGES**\n\n**Reasoning:** While performance optimization (warm-up) is valid, interacting with the **Governance** layer requires strict isolation of data. The current proposal lacks evidence regarding how the synthetic traffic will be segregated from legal/compliance logs. We cannot approve a process that might compromise the integrity of safety auditing. Please provide the tagging strategy and log filtering evidence.",
