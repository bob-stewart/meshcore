      "summary": "# AI-IRB Panel Assessment\n\n## Summary Review: Hourly Dogfood — Governance Engine Warm-Up\n\n---\n\n## 1) RISK: **LOW**\n\n---\n\n## 2) CONCERNS:\n\n- **Scope ambiguity**: \"Governance engine warm-up\" is vaguely described — it is unclear whether this involves executing governance rules against live data, synthetic data, or simply pre-loading models/caches. The distinction matters for data exposure and side-effect risk.\n- **Hourly cadence**: An hourly recurring ops-script touching the governance surface introduces a persistent attack surface and a recurring window for unintended side effects (e.g., state corruption, resource exhaustion, log noise).\n- **\"Dogfood\" framing**: Dogfooding implies self-referential evaluation — if the governance engine is evaluating its own outputs or policies, there is a risk of circular reasoning or self-reinforcing approval patterns that erode oversight integrity.\n- **Single evidence artifact**: Only one evidence ID is provided (20260216T041956Z). Insufficient to establish a pattern of safe behavior or thorough testing.\n- **Blast radius on governance surface**: Any change to the governance surface, even a warm-up script, could inadvertently alter cached policy states, decision logs, or audit trails if not carefully isolated.\n- **Observability**: No mention of monitoring, alerting, or rollback mechanisms for the hourly execution.\n\n---\n\n## 3) REQUIRED_GATES:\n\n- **Detailed design document** clarifying exactly what \"warm-up\" entails — what is loaded, what is executed, what data (if any) is touched, and what state (if any) is mutated.\n- **Isolation verification**: Evidence that the warm-up process is read-only or operates in a sandboxed context with no write access to production governance state or decision logs.\n- **Idempotency proof**: Demonstration that repeated hourly execution produces no cumulative side effects (state drift, log pollution, resource leak).\n- **Dry-run results**: At least 72 hours of dry-run execution logs showing no anomalies, with comparison against baseline governance engine behavior.\n- **Monitoring and alerting plan**: Defined alerts for warm-up failures, latency spikes, or unexpected governance state changes.\n- **Rollback procedure**: Documented and tested mechanism to disable the hourly job immediately without manual intervention (e.g., kill switch, feature flag).\n- **Security review**: Confirmation that the ops-script does not introduce credential exposure, privilege escalation, or new network surface.\n- **Audit trail integrity check**: Verification that warm-up executions are clearly distinguishable from real governance decisions in all logs and audit records (to prevent confusion during incident review or compliance audits).\n\n---\n\n## 4) RECOMMENDATION: **REQUEST_CHANGES**\n\n**Rationale**: The proposal is low-risk in concept but insufficiently specified for a surface as sensitive as governance. The single evidence artifact and vague description do not meet the evidentiary bar for a recurring automated process touching governance infrastructure. The core concern is not that this is dangerous — it is that governance surfaces demand a higher standard of documentation and isolation proof precisely *because* they are the control plane. Approve once the required gates above are satisfied; none should be onerous for a genuinely low-risk warm-up script.",
