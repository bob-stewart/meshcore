      "summary": "1) RISK: **MEDIUM**\n\n2) CONCERNS:\n*   **Audit Log Pollution:** Governance logs are often legal records. Injecting hourly synthetic traffic into the governance engine risks polluting audit trails, making it difficult to distinguish between real policy evaluations and warm-up noise during forensic investigations.\n*   **Unintended Side Effects (State Mutation):** \"Warm-up\" implies activity to load caches. If this involves write operations or state transitions (even temporary ones), there is a risk of the script accidentally enforcing policies, locking resources, or altering configurations in the production dogfood environment.\n*   **Resource Contention:** Running this hourly could coincide with legitimate high-load governance tasks (e.g., batch compliance reporting), potentially causing latency in actual safety enforcement.\n*   **Alert Fatigue/False Positives:** If the warm-up script fails or returns an unexpected result, it may trigger high-severity alerts intended for actual governance failures, desensitizing the on-call team.\n\n3) REQUIRED_GATES:\n*   **Read-Only Verification:** Static analysis or code review evidence confirming the script performs strictly read-only operations (e.g., `GET` requests or dry-run policy evaluations) and cannot mutate state.\n*   **Synthetic Traffic Tagging:** Evidence that all requests generated by this script are explicitly tagged (e.g., `X-Is-Synthetic: true` or specific user-agent) to ensure they can be filtered out of compliance audits and metrics.\n*   **Resource Impact Analysis:** A canary run report showing CPU/Memory usage of the governance engine during the warm-up routine to prove it does not degrade latency for concurrent real-time requests.\n*   **Failure Mode Documentation:** A defined protocol for what happens if the warm-up fails (e.g., \"fail silently\" vs. \"page on-call\"). Ideally, this should fail silently to avoid paging humans for a non-critical utility script.\n\n4) RECOMMENDATION: **REQUEST_CHANGES**\n\n*Reasoning: While performance optimization is valid, touching the governance surface requires strict proof of isolation. We cannot approve until we see evidence that this script is incapable of writing state or polluting the legal audit trail.*",
