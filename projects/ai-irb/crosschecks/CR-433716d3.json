      "summary": "1) **RISK: MEDIUM**\n\n2) **CONCERNS**\n- **Blast radius to governance plane:** “governance engine warm-up” touching governance systems can impact policy evaluation, approvals, enforcement, and audit integrity if it misbehaves.\n- **Hourly scheduling risk:** Increased frequency can amplify any latent bug (resource leaks, deadlocks, queue buildup) and create chronic background load.\n- **Ops-script safety:** Scripts often run with broad permissions; risk of credential leakage, accidental writes, or unintended mutations if “warm-up” is not strictly read-only.\n- **Stateful side effects:** “Warm-up” can unintentionally create/modify cached state, precompute artifacts, or trigger background jobs that alter outcomes (non-idempotent behavior).\n- **Failure-mode ambiguity:** If warm-up fails, unclear whether it pages, retries aggressively, or blocks governance engine availability.\n- **Observability/audit gaps:** Governance-related actions need strong traceability; dogfood jobs can muddy audit logs unless clearly labeled.\n- **Environment separation:** Risk that dogfood hits prod-like data or prod endpoints without strict safeguards.\n- **Security/compliance:** Governance systems typically fall under stricter change-control; any new automation must meet least-privilege and logging requirements.\n\n3) **REQUIRED_GATES**\n- **Design/behavior spec:** Written description of what “warm-up” does (APIs called, data accessed, read/write behavior), explicit statement that it is **idempotent** and **no-op on state** (or enumerate permitted side effects).\n- **Least-privilege review:** Service account permissions documented; evidence of principle-of-least-privilege (read-only where possible), secrets handling, and token scope validation.\n- **Staging + canary plan:** Run in non-prod first; then prod canary (e.g., 1%/single region/single shard) with defined success criteria.\n- **Load/perf evidence:** Measurements showing added CPU/memory/QPS and cache impact; confirm no SLO regression for governance engine under peak load.\n- **Failure handling test:** Demonstrate bounded retries, timeouts, and that warm-up failure does **not** block or degrade governance engine core functionality; clear paging policy.\n- **Rollback/kill switch:** One-step disablement (feature flag / scheduler toggle) and a tested rollback procedure for ops-scripts and any config changes.\n- **Monitoring & alerting:** Dashboards and alerts for job duration, error rate, rate-limits, governance latency, cache hit/miss changes, and resource consumption.\n- **Audit/log hygiene:** Logs tagged as “warm-up/dogfood,” with correlation IDs; confirm no sensitive data logged; retention consistent with governance requirements.\n- **Change-management evidence:** Link to code review, security review (if applicable), and approval from governance owners; include runbook and oncall ownership.\n\n4) **RECOMMENDATION: REQUEST_CHANGES**",

      "summary": "1) **RISK:** MEDIUM\n\n2) **CONCERNS:**\n*   **Metric Pollution:** Introducing hourly synthetic or internal traffic into the governance engine risks skewing safety metrics (e.g., false positive rates, violation counts), potentially masking real trends in adversarial usage.\n*   **Feedback Loop/Model Drift:** If the governance engine utilizes online learning or if this traffic is captured for future fine-tuning, the \"warm-up\" data (likely repetitive or synthetic) could bias the model.\n*   **Alert Fatigue:** If the dogfooding inputs trigger violation flags, this could generate noise for the Trust & Safety on-call team unless specifically suppressed.\n*   **Privilege Escalation/Side Effects:** Since this runs via `ops-scripts`, there is a concern regarding what permissions the script holds. Does the \"warm-up\" merely check the engine, or does it trigger enforcement actions (e.g., banning the test user, locking resources)?\n*   **Production Latency:** Hourly spikes in governance processing could impact latency for concurrent real-time user requests if not rate-limited or prioritized lower.\n\n3) **REQUIRED_GATES:**\n*   **Data Isolation Plan:** Evidence that the input data used for the warm-up is either purely synthetic or strictly segregated from production user data (no PII).\n*   **Telemetry Tagging:** Confirmation that all logs and metrics generated by this script are tagged (e.g., `is_synthetic=true` or `source=dogfood`) to allow for exclusion from safety dashboards and compliance reports.\n*   **\"No-Op\" Enforcement Verification:** Proof that while the governance engine processes the request, no downstream enforcement actions (bans, blocks, reports to authorities) are executed for this specific traffic source.\n*   **Training Exclusion:** Confirmation that data logs from this source are explicitly excluded from future model training or evaluation datasets.\n*   **Load Impact Analysis:** A brief estimate of compute cost and latency impact on the production governance cluster during the hourly run.\n\n4) **RECOMMENDATION:** REQUEST_CHANGES\n\n*Reasoning: While keeping the governance engine warm is operationally sound to prevent cold starts, interacting with the safety layer requires strict hygiene to prevent data poisoning and metric corruption.
