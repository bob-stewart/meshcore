      "summary": "1) RISK: **MEDIUM**\n\n2) CONCERNS:\n*   **Audit Log Pollution:** High-frequency (hourly) synthetic traffic may obscure genuine governance violations or complicate forensic analysis if not clearly distinguishable from production traffic.\n*   **Resource Contention:** \"Warm-up\" scripts can inadvertently consume rate limits or compute resources needed for live, user-facing governance checks, potentially introducing latency.\n*   **Alert Fatigue:** If the dogfood payload triggers safety violations (to test the engine), it may flood security operations channels with false positives.\n*   **Data Hygiene:** There is no specification regarding the payload data. Using production data for dogfooding risks PII leakage into operational logs; using synthetic data requires validation that it accurately represents complex governance scenarios.\n*   **Failure Mode:** If the script fails or hangs, does it block the governance engine (fail-closed) or allow traffic without checks (fail-open)?\n\n3) REQUIRED_GATES:\n*   **Payload Sanitization Verification:** Evidence that the \"dogfood\" payload contains strictly synthetic data or non-sensitive, pre-approved internal datasets.\n*   **Traffic Tagging/Isolation:** Proof that requests generated by this script include specific headers or metadata (e.g., `X-Internal-Test: true`) to allow exclusion from production analytics and compliance audits.\n*   **Non-Blocking Execution:** Code review confirming the script runs asynchronously and its failure cannot degrade the availability of the main governance service.\n*   **Alert Suppression Plan:** Configuration showing that alerts generated by this specific source/script are routed to a testing channel, not the critical incident response queue.\n*   **Load Impact Analysis:** A brief test result showing CPU/Memory impact of the warm-up routine on the governance container.\n\n4) RECOMMENDATION: **REQUEST_CHANGES**\n\n*Reasoning: While keeping the governance engine warm to prevent cold starts is a valid operational goal, the lack of detail regarding data payloads and log separation presents a defensibility risk. We need to ensure this automation does not compromise the integrity of our compliance records.*",
