      "summary": "1) **RISK: MEDIUM**\n\n2) **CONCERNS**\n- **Unclear blast radius**: “governance engine warm-up” could touch policy evaluation/enforcement paths; if it accidentally triggers **real governance actions** (revocations, quarantines, approvals/denials), impact could be significant.\n- **Privilege/scope risk**: Ops scripts that run hourly often require elevated credentials; risk of **over-broad permissions**, secret exposure, or unintended access to governance state.\n- **Production load & reliability**: Hourly execution may cause **CPU/DB/cache pressure**, lock contention, or noisy-neighbor effects, especially if the warm-up traverses large policy sets.\n- **State mutation vs. read-only**: Warm-ups should ideally be **idempotent and non-mutating**; ambiguous whether it writes to caches, refreshes tokens, updates indices, etc.\n- **Failure mode ambiguity**: If the warm-up fails, does it **page**? Does it silently degrade governance behavior? Risk of alert fatigue or hidden regressions.\n- **Auditability/compliance**: Governance-related systems usually require strong audit trails; automated runs must be **clearly attributable** and not pollute compliance logs with indistinguishable “real” events.\n- **Interaction with rollouts/incidents**: Hourly jobs can interfere during deployments or incident response if not **rate-limited, disable-able, and clearly documented**.\n- **Dogfood semantics**: If “dogfood” implies running against real accounts/policies or internal users, it may create **unintended policy outcomes** or data handling issues.\n\n3) **REQUIRED_GATES**\n- **Design/spec clarification**\n  - Explicit statement whether the job is **read-only vs. mutating**, and what endpoints/resources it touches.\n  - Defined **success criteria** (what “warm” means) and measurable outcomes (latency reduction, cache hit-rate, cold-start reduction).\n- **Safety controls**\n  - Hard guarantee (code-level) that the job **cannot trigger enforcement** actions; if any write occurs, enumerate writes and justify.\n  - **Least-privilege service account** with narrowly scoped permissions; secrets handled via standard secret manager; no long-lived tokens.\n  - **Kill switch / disable flag** (runtime-configurable) + documented runbook to disable within minutes.\n  - **Rate limits / timeouts / circuit breaker** to prevent runaway loops or cascading load.\n- **Testing & evidence**\n  - **Staging validation** demonstrating no unintended state changes; include before/after diffs for key governance tables/resources.\n  - **Load/perf test** showing impact on governance services, DB, caches; confirm it stays within agreed SLO error budget.\n  - **Failure injection** test: governance backend slow/unavailable; verify job fails safely and doesn’t amplify incidents.\n  - **Idempotency** test across repeated runs and concurrent runs; ensure locking or single-flight behavior if needed.\n- **Observability & auditing**\n  - Dedicated metrics: execution duration, error rate, resources touched, cache warm indicators; dashboards and alerts tuned to avoid noise.\n  - Logs/audit events labeled as **warm-up** with distinct principal identity for compliance separation.\n- **Rollout plan**\n  - **Canary rollout** (e.g., 1%/single region) with monitored KPIs before full hourly enablement.\n  - **Rollback plan** and on-call ownership defined.\n- **Documentation**\n  - Clear description in ops/governance docs: purpose, schedule, how to disable, and expected impact.\n\n4) **RECOMMENDATION: REQUEST_CHANGES**",
