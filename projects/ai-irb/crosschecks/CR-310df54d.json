      "summary": "1) **RISK:** MEDIUM\n\n2) **CONCERNS:**\n*   **Audit Log Pollution:** Injecting hourly synthetic traffic (\"dogfooding\") into the live governance engine risks contaminating compliance logs and audit trails, making it difficult to distinguish between real safety interventions and warm-up exercises.\n*   **Resource Contention:** If the warm-up script is aggressive, it may introduce latency or locking issues for legitimate requests requiring real-time governance checks.\n*   **Failure Mode Behavior:** It is unclear how the system behaves if the warm-up script fails. A failure in the ops-script must not trigger a \"fail-open\" state in the governance engine or trigger false positive alerts to the on-call safety team.\n*   **Privilege Scope:** Ops-scripts often run with elevated privileges. There is a risk that this script possesses broader write-access to the governance configuration than is necessary for a simple warm-up routine.\n\n3) **REQUIRED_GATES:**\n*   **Data Segregation Verification:** Evidence that all telemetry and logs generated by this script are explicitly tagged (e.g., `is_synthetic=true`) and excluded from standard compliance reporting.\n*   **Resource Impact Analysis:** A load test report showing that the hourly execution does not increase P99 latency for concurrent live governance requests.\n*   **Least Privilege Review:** Confirmation that the service account running the ops-script has `read-only` or restricted execution permissions, preventing it from modifying governance policies.\n*   **Alerting Suppression:** Proof that the monitoring system distinguishes between a failure of the warm-up script and a failure of the governance engine itself.\n\n4) **RECOMMENDATION:** REQUEST_CHANGES",
