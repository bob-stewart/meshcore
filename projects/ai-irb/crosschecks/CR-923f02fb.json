      "summary": "1) **RISK: HIGH**\n\n2) **CONCERNS:**\n- **Governance surface impact:** “Warm-up” logic in/around a governance engine can unintentionally change enforcement behavior (policy evaluation timing/caching, stale state, side effects).\n- **Privilege & blast radius:** Ops scripts that touch governance systems often run with elevated credentials; an hourly job increases the window for credential misuse and accidental writes.\n- **Side effects disguised as “warm-up”:** If the warm-up path triggers real reads/writes (e.g., policy fetch, cache fill, DB migrations, token refresh, queue consumers), it may cause unintended state changes.\n- **System load / cascading failure:** Hourly execution can create periodic load spikes; if it overlaps across fleets/timezones it can amplify (thundering herd), impacting latency/availability of governance checks.\n- **Failure mode ambiguity:** If warm-up fails, unclear whether it blocks governance, degrades to insecure defaults, or masks real issues (false sense of readiness).\n- **Observability gaps:** Without explicit metrics/logging/alerting, repeated failures or slowdowns could go unnoticed while still affecting production.\n- **Change control & auditability:** Governance-related changes require strong audit trails; cron/ops-script changes can be hard to trace and may bypass normal deployment rigor.\n- **Rollback complexity:** Scheduled jobs can persist and continue running even after partial rollback unless explicitly managed.\n\n3) **REQUIRED_GATES:**\n- **Design clarification (must be written):**\n  - Exact warm-up actions (read-only vs write), target services/endpoints, data accessed, and expected side effects (ideally “none”).\n  - Explicit statement of **security posture on failure** (fail-closed vs fail-open) and why.\n- **Least-privilege review:**\n  - Documented service account/role used by the hourly job; demonstrate it has **minimum required permissions** (prefer read-only).\n  - Secret management plan (rotation, storage, access logging).\n- **Safety controls in implementation:**\n  - Hard **timeouts**, **rate limits**, and **circuit breaker** to prevent runaway execution.\n  - **Jitter** / staggering to avoid thundering herd.\n  - **Idempotency** guarantee (re-running does not change state).\n  - **No production writes** unless explicitly justified and separately approved.\n- **Testing evidence:**\n  - Staging test showing warm-up completes under load and does not change governance outcomes (policy decisions identical pre/post).\n  - Negative tests: downstream dependency unavailable, network partial failure, auth failure—verify safe behavior and bounded retries.\n- **Operational readiness:**\n  - Metrics: success/failure counts, duration, dependency latency, cache hit rates (if applicable), and governance decision latency.\n  - Alerts on repeated failures and abnormal duration/latency.\n  - Runbook: how to disable the job quickly, how to roll back, and how to verify governance correctness after changes.\n- **Deployment gating:**\n  - Progressive rollout (canary) with explicit stop conditions.\n  - Confirmation that job scheduling is managed via the same audited deployment pipeline as other production changes.\n- **Audit/compliance:**\n  - Logging sufficient to reconstruct what ran, when, under what identity, and what was contacted (without leaking secrets/PII).\n\n4) **RECOMMENDATION: REQUEST_CHANGES**\n\nReason: The change touches **governance** and introduces a **recurring automated execution path**. Without concrete evidence about side effects, permissions, failure behavior, and monitoring, it’s not defensible to approve as-is.",

      "summary": "1) RISK: **MEDIUM**\n\n2) CONCERNS:\n*   **Telemetry Pollution:** Automated hourly traffic to the governance engine risks skewing safety metrics, false positive rates, and latency statistics if not strictly tagged and segregated from production user traffic.\n*   **Payload Safety:** It is unclear what data is being used for the \"warm-up.\" If the script uses adversarial examples (red-teaming prompts) to test the governance engine, there is a risk of these prompts leaking into persistent logs or training datasets without proper \"toxic\" labeling.\n*   **Resource Contention:** Hourly spikes in governance processing could degrade latency for concurrent real-time user requests if priority queuing is not established.\n*   **Alert Fatigue:** If the warm-up script fails (e.g., due to a timeout), it may trigger high-severity alerts for the safety team, leading to desensitization to actual governance failures.\n\n3) REQUIRED_GATES:\n*   **Traffic Segregation Plan:** Evidence that all \"dogfood/warm-up\" requests carry a specific header or metadata tag to exclude them from production safety dashboards and compliance audits.\n*   **Payload Manifest:** A review of the specific prompts/inputs used in the warm-up script. (Must confirm inputs are static and benign, or if adversarial, that they are sandboxed).\n*   **Load Impact Analysis:** Data showing that the hourly execution does not consume more than 5% of available governance compute capacity or increase P99 latency for user traffic.\n*   **Failure Logic Documentation:** Confirmation that script failures result in `INFO` or `WARNING` level logs for the Ops team, rather than `CRITICAL` pages for the Safety/Governance team.\n\n4) RECOMMENDATION: **REQUEST_CHANGES**\n\n*Rationale: While warming up the engine to prevent cold starts is operationally sound, automating interactions with the Governance layer requires strict observability hygiene. We need proof that this synthetic traffic will not corrupt our safety reporting or audit trails before approval.*",
