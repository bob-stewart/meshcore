      "summary": "1) **RISK: MEDIUM**\n\n2) **CONCERNS:**\n*   **State Mutation Risk:** There is a risk that the \"warm-up\" routine might inadvertently trigger state changes (e.g., policy enforcement actions, token revocations, or account lockouts) rather than simply querying the engine.\n*   **Audit Log Pollution:** Hourly execution against the governance engine may flood security audit logs with synthetic traffic, making it difficult to distinguish between automated warm-up events and genuine security incidents or policy violations.\n*   **Resource Contention:** If the governance engine shares resources with production traffic, an hourly spike in complex policy evaluation (dogfooding) could introduce latency for actual user requests.\n*   **Alert Fatigue:** If the warm-up script fails (e.g., due to a transient network issue), it must be configured to avoid paging on-call engineers for non-critical internal test failures, preventing alert fatigue.\n*   **Internal Lockout:** Since this is \"dogfooding\" (running on internal infrastructure), a bug in the script or the governance rules it triggers could theoretically lock internal operators out of their own systems.\n\n3) **REQUIRED_GATES:**\n*   **Idempotency/Read-Only Verification:** Evidence demonstrating that the warm-up script runs in a \"dry-run\" or \"read-only\" mode and cannot alter the state of the governance database or enforcement layer.\n*   **Log Segregation Plan:** Confirmation that events generated by this script are tagged (e.g., `source: synthetic-warmup`) to allow for easy filtering in SIEM/audit tools.\n*   **Resource Impact Analysis:** A load test result showing the CPU/Memory footprint of the warm-up routine compared to available headroom on the governance nodes.\n*   **Kill Switch Validation:** Documentation of the mechanism to immediately disable the cron/script without a full deployment cycle in case of malfunction.\n*   **Failure Mode Definition:** Confirmation that if the warm-up fails, it does not degrade the availability of the governance engine for external traffic (fail-safe).\n\n4) **RECOMMENDATION: REQUEST_CHANGES**\n\n**Reasoning:** While warming up the engine is a standard operational practice to reduce cold-start latency, touching the **governance** layer requires strict guarantees that the automation is non-mutating and non-disruptive. The current summary does not explicitly confirm that this process is read-only or how it handles audit logging. These protections must be documented before approval.",
