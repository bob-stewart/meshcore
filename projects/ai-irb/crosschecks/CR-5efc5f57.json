      "summary": "1) **RISK: MEDIUM**\n\n2) **CONCERNS:**\n*   **Audit Log Pollution:** High-frequency (hourly) synthetic traffic through the governance engine risks diluting genuine safety logs and complicating post-incident forensics.\n*   **Unintended Enforcement:** Without strict isolation, \"dogfooding\" payloads might trigger actual enforcement actions (e.g., banning internal IPs, locking service accounts, or throttling production traffic).\n*   **Resource Contention:** \"Warm-up\" scripts can artificially inflate compute usage; if the governance engine is under load, this script could introduce latency to real-time safety checks for actual users.\n*   **Failure Modes:** If the ops-script fails or hangs, there is a risk it could lock the governance database or cause the engine to become unresponsive to production requests.\n\n3) **REQUIRED_GATES:**\n*   **Isolation Verification:** Evidence that the dogfood traffic is tagged (e.g., `synthetic=true`) and explicitly excluded from production compliance reports and enforcement triggers.\n*   **Dry-Run Confirmation:** Code review or log evidence proving the script runs in a read-only/dry-run capacity and cannot mutate governance policies or ban lists.\n*   **Resource Profiling:** Metrics demonstrating that the warm-up routine consumes <1% of available resources and de-prioritizes itself during high-traffic periods.\n*   **Alert Suppression Test:** Confirmation that the specific payloads used for dogfooding do not trigger high-severity on-call alerts.\n\n4) **RECOMMENDATION: REQUEST_CHANGES**\n*   *Reasoning:* While keeping the governance engine warm to prevent cold starts is operationally sound, touching the `governance` surface requires strict proof that synthetic tests cannot result in production enforcement actions. The current summary does not detail how log pollution and accidental enforcement are prevented.",
