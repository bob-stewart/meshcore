      "summary": "1) **RISK:** MEDIUM\n\n2) **CONCERNS:**\n*   **Log Pollution & Forensics:** Hourly execution against the governance engine risks flooding safety logs with test data. This complicates auditing and post-incident forensics if \"dogfood\" traffic is not strictly segregated from user traffic.\n*   **Data Privacy:** It is unclear if the \"warm-up\" inputs are derived from replayed production traffic (posing a PII/privacy risk) or synthetic probes.\n*   **State Mutation:** There is a risk that the warm-up script could inadvertently alter dynamic thresholds, adaptive safety scores, or rate-limiting counters within the governance engine, affecting production behavior.\n*   **Alert Fatigue:** If the warm-up fails due to minor infrastructure latency rather than logic errors, it may trigger high-severity safety alerts, desensitizing on-call engineers to actual governance failures.\n\n3) **REQUIRED_GATES:**\n*   **Traffic Segregation Verification:** Evidence that all logs generated by this script are explicitly tagged (e.g., `source=dogfood`) and excluded from standard safety compliance reporting.\n*   **Input Data Audit:** Confirmation that input prompts are 100% synthetic or strictly sanitized; usage of raw production data for dogfooding is prohibited without a separate privacy review.\n*   **Read-Only Enforcement:** Code review confirming the script possesses strictly read-only permissions regarding governance policy configurations and state databases.\n*   **Failure Mode Documentation:** A defined protocol for how script failures are handled (e.g., silent fail vs. paging) to prevent false positives in safety monitoring.\n\n4) **RECOMMENDATION:** REQUEST_CHANGES",
