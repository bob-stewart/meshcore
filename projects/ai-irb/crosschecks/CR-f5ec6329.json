      "summary": "1) **RISK: MEDIUM**\n\n2) **CONCERNS:**\n*   **Audit Log Pollution:** The Governance engine is a critical compliance surface. Injecting hourly synthetic traffic risks polluting audit trails, making it difficult to distinguish between real policy enforcement and \"warm-up\" activities during a forensic review.\n*   **Resource Contention:** There is a risk that the \"warm-up\" process could consume rate limits or compute resources needed for live production traffic, potentially introducing latency to legitimate safety checks.\n*   **Alert Fatigue:** If the warm-up involves simulating policy-violating payloads to exercise the engine, it may trigger false positive alerts to the Trust & Safety or Security Operations teams.\n*   **State Corruption:** If the governance engine maintains state (e.g., reputation scores, ban lists), repeated testing against a specific internal user/entity could inadvertently trigger a permanent ban or degrade the reputation score of the test account, breaking the test loop.\n\n3) **REQUIRED_GATES:**\n*   **Data Segregation Plan:** Evidence that all logs/telemetry generated by this script are tagged (e.g., `traffic_type=synthetic` or `source=dogfood`) and can be easily filtered out of compliance reports.\n*   **Latency Impact Analysis:** A pre-deployment test showing that the warm-up routine does not increase P99 latency for concurrent production governance requests.\n*   **Alert Suppression Verification:** Confirmation from the Security Operations team that the specific signature of this traffic is whitelisted in alerting systems to prevent on-call paging.\n*   **Identity Isolation:** Confirmation that the script uses a dedicated service account with scoped permissions, not a shared admin credential or a human user's identity.\n\n4) **RECOMMENDATION: REQUEST_CHANGES**\n\n*Reasoning: While keeping the engine warm is operationally sound, the proposal lacks detail on how the resulting data will be kept separate from legal/compliance audit trails. We cannot approve automated interaction with the Governance surface without a confirmed strategy to prevent log pollution.*",
