      "summary": "1) RISK: **MEDIUM**\n\n2) CONCERNS:\n*   **Audit Log Pollution:** High-frequency (hourly) synthetic traffic against the governance engine risks diluting or obscuring genuine compliance logs and safety violations, making post-incident forensics difficult.\n*   **Resource Contention:** \"Warm-up\" implies generating load. There is a risk that this script could consume rate limits or compute resources shared with production traffic, potentially causing latency in safety checks for real users.\n*   **State Mutation Risk:** The summary is vague regarding whether the \"warm-up\" involves read-only operations or if it creates temporary policy states. Modifying governance state (even temporarily) introduces a risk of configuration drift or accidental policy enforcement failure.\n*   **Alert Fatigue:** If the warm-up script fails (e.g., due to network blips), it must be distinguished from a genuine failure of the governance engine to prevent on-call fatigue.\n\n3) REQUIRED_GATES:\n*   **Synthetic Traffic Tagging:** Evidence that all requests generated by this script are explicitly tagged (e.g., `X-Synthetic-Traffic: true`) to ensure they can be filtered out of compliance audits and usage metrics.\n*   **Idempotency & Read-Only Verification:** Code review or trace logs confirming the script performs non-mutating operations (or strictly idempotent ones) and does not alter active safety policies.\n*   **Resource Isolation Plan:** Documentation showing that this script runs with a dedicated, low-priority quota or service tier that cannot starve production governance requests.\n*   **Failure Mode Analysis:** A brief explanation of what happens if the script hangs or crashes—specifically confirming it fails closed without blocking the governance engine.\n\n4) RECOMMENDATION: **REQUEST_CHANGES**\n\n*Reasoning: While keeping the governance engine warm is operationally sound, the \"governance\" surface is critical for safety enforcement. We cannot approve an hourly automated script against this surface without explicit evidence that it will not pollute audit trails or accidentally modify safety policies.*",
