      "summary": "1) RISK: **MEDIUM**\n\n2) CONCERNS:\n*   **Audit Log Pollution:** \"Dogfooding\" the governance engine implies sending synthetic requests through the safety layer. If these are not rigorously segregated from production traffic logs, it will compromise the integrity of safety audits and compliance reporting.\n*   **Resource Contention:** While intended to \"warm up\" the engine (likely to reduce cold-start latency), an hourly script running against the production governance surface risks locking resources or introducing latency spikes for actual user traffic if not properly throttled.\n*   **Alert Fatigue:** If the warm-up script fails (e.g., due to a transient network issue), it must not trigger high-severity security alerts (e.g., \"Governance Engine Down\"), which would desensitize on-call responders to real incidents.\n*   **Privilege Scope:** The script requires permission to invoke the governance engine. There is a risk that the credentials used for this script could be exploited if not scoped strictly to \"invoke only\" without administrative modification rights.\n\n3) REQUIRED_GATES:\n*   **Synthetic Traffic Tagging:** Evidence that all telemetry, logs, and audit trails generated by this script are explicitly tagged (e.g., `traffic_type: synthetic` or `source: dogfood`) to ensure they can be filtered out of compliance reports.\n*   **Non-Blocking Execution:** Proof that the script executes asynchronously and has a hard timeout to prevent it from hanging the governance service.\n*   **Failure Mode Analysis:** Documentation showing that if the script fails, it fails silently (logging an error) rather than crashing the service or blocking the deployment pipeline.\n*   **Staging Soak Test:** Results from a 24-hour run in the staging environment to confirm no memory leaks or gradual performance degradation occur over time.\n\n4) RECOMMENDATION: **REQUEST_CHANGES**\n\n*Reasoning: While the intent to reduce latency is valid, modifying the operational cadence of the governance engine—the primary safety enforcement mechanism—requires proof that the \"noise\" generated by the warm-up will not hide the \"signal\" of real safety violations. The tagging strategy for logs must be defined before approval.*",
