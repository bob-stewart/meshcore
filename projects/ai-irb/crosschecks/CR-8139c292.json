      "summary": "1) RISK: **MEDIUM**\n\n2) CONCERNS:\n*   **Audit Log Pollution:** Introducing hourly synthetic traffic into the governance engine risks obscuring genuine policy violations or compliance incidents in audit logs.\n*   **State Modification Risk:** The term \"warm-up\" is ambiguous. If the script performs write operations (even temporary caching) rather than strictly read-only checks, it risks corrupting live policy states or configuration data.\n*   **Failure Mode Behavior:** If the governance engine fails the warm-up check, there is a risk of triggering false positive incident alerts or, worse, causing the governance system to fail-closed (blocking legitimate traffic) or fail-open (bypassing safety checks).\n*   **Resource Contention:** Automated ops-scripts running on a schedule can inadvertently consume rate limits or compute resources needed for real-time user safety checks.\n\n3) REQUIRED_GATES:\n*   **Read-Only Verification:** Code review or static analysis evidence confirming the script utilizes read-only endpoints (e.g., `dry-run` flags) and cannot alter policy definitions or enforcement rules.\n*   **Telemetry Tagging:** Demonstration that all logs and metrics generated by this script are explicitly tagged (e.g., `traffic_type: synthetic`) to ensure they are filterable from compliance audits.\n*   **Failure Isolation Test:** Evidence showing that if the warm-up script fails or times out, it does not degrade the availability of the governance engine for production traffic.\n*   **Privilege Least-Privilege:** Confirmation that the service account running the ops-script has the minimum necessary permissions (specifically, no admin/write access to the governance core).\n\n4) RECOMMENDATION: **REQUEST_CHANGES**\n\n*Rationale: While keeping a governance engine warm is operationally sound, interacting with the safety layer via automated scripts requires strict isolation guarantees to prevent \"ghost\" violations or accidental policy drift. The current summary lacks evidence regarding read-only enforcement and log separation.*",
