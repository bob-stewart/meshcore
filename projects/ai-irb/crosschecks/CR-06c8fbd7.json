      "summary": "1) **RISK: HIGH**\n\n2) **CONCERNS:**\n- **Governance integrity risk:** “Warm-up” of a governance engine can unintentionally **apply or mutate policy state** (vs. purely caching/priming), creating silent policy drift or enforcement changes.\n- **Privilege / blast-radius risk:** Ops-scripts touching governance commonly run with elevated credentials; an hourly job increases the window for **credential misuse**, misconfiguration, or accidental destructive actions.\n- **Data exposure risk:** Dogfooding often involves real internal data; warm-up may **load sensitive artifacts** (policies, exceptions, user/org mappings) into caches/logs/metrics unintentionally.\n- **Auditability gaps:** Hourly automation can generate many actions/events; without strong logging/traceability it becomes hard to **attribute** changes or detect anomalies.\n- **Reliability/performance risk:** Hourly warm-up could introduce **periodic load spikes**, contention, or cascading failures in governance dependencies; risk of impacting enforcement latency.\n- **Idempotency and side effects unclear:** If the warm-up path is not strictly read-only and idempotent, repeated runs can accumulate state, leak resources, or grow caches unbounded.\n- **Rollback ambiguity:** If the warm-up modifies state or caches shared across tenants/environments, rollback may be non-trivial.\n- **Evidence insufficiency:** Only an evidence ID is provided; no description of exact behavior (read-only vs mutating), environments affected, permissions, or safeguards.\n\n3) **REQUIRED_GATES (before approval):**\n- **Design & scope clarification**\n  - Explicit statement: warm-up is **read-only** (no writes, no policy compilation outputs persisted to authoritative stores) OR full enumeration of any writes with justification.\n  - Definition of **which environment(s)** run hourly (dev/staging/prod), and whether dogfood includes **real user/org data**.\n- **Security / privacy**\n  - **Least-privilege review** for the job identity (scoped credentials, no broad admin; time-bound tokens; secret storage controls).\n  - **Data classification + privacy impact assessment**: confirm what data is accessed, cached, logged; ensure redaction and retention limits.\n  - **Threat model** covering abuse of the hourly job path (credential theft, injection via inputs, log exfiltration).\n- **Safety / correctness**\n  - Demonstrated **idempotency** and “no side effects” tests (or explicit side-effects with invariants).\n  - Unit/integration tests proving warm-up does not change effective governance decisions except expected performance improvements.\n  - **Dry-run mode** validation in staging that produces identical governance outputs pre/post warm-up.\n- **Operational controls**\n  - **Canary rollout** plan (small subset of dogfood tenants/users first) with success metrics and automatic rollback criteria.\n  - **Rate limiting / backoff** and resource caps to prevent load spikes; SLO impact assessment.\n  - **Monitoring & alerting**: latency, error rates, policy-eval divergence, cache size, job duration, dependency health.\n  - **Audit logging**: every run must emit traceable logs (who/what/when), with correlation IDs and immutable retention.\n  - **Rollback/kill switch**: immediate disable mechanism (feature flag) and documented runbook.\n- **Compliance evidence**\n  - Link the **EVIDENCE_IDS: 20260228T101955Z** to concrete artifacts: code diff, test results, staging run reports, security review sign-off.\n\n4) **RECOMMENDATION: REQUEST_CHANGES**",

      "summary": "1) **RISK:** MEDIUM\n\n2) **CONCERNS:**\n*   **State Modification Risks:** \"Dogfooding\" implies usage in a live environment. If the \"warm-up\" involves write operations (e.g., toggling policies on/off or creating dummy rules to test the engine), a script failure could leave the governance engine in an insecure or inconsistent state.\n*   **Audit Log Pollution:** Hourly execution will generate significant noise in governance audit logs. This complicates forensic analysis and may mask genuine malicious activity or policy violations.\n*   **Resource Contention:** If the governance engine locks tables or consumes significant compute during evaluation, running this hourly could introduce latency for legitimate production operations.\n*   **Alert Fatigue:** If the warm-up script fails (e.g., due to a transient network issue), it must be determined if this triggers a high-severity page. Frequent false alarms will desensitize the on-call team to real governance failures.\n*   **Privilege Scope:** The script requires access to the governance surface. If the script's credentials are compromised, an attacker could potentially alter governance rules.\n\n3) **REQUIRED_GATES:**\n*   **Read-Only Verification:** Evidence (code diff or architectural diagram) confirming the script performs `READ` operations only (e.g., querying a policy status) and does not perform `WRITE` operations against the governance database.\n*   **Staging Soak Test:** Results from a 24-hour run in the Staging environment demonstrating no impact on API latency or database CPU.\n*   **Log Segregation Plan:** Configuration showing that events generated by this script are tagged (e.g., `source:synthetic`) and filtered out of standard security audit dashboards.\n*   **Failure Mode Analysis:** Documentation defining what happens if the script hangs or fails. It must fail closed (securely) and not degrade the governance engine's availability.\n*   **Least Privilege Review:** Confirmation that the service account running the script has the minimum necessary permissions (e.g., `GovernanceViewer` rather than `GovernanceAdmin`).\n\n4) **RECOMMENDATION:** REQUEST_CHANGES\n\n*Reasoning: While keeping the governance engine warm is valid for performance, interacting with the governance layer via automated scripts carries a risk of accidental policy modification or audit blindness. We need explicit confirmation that this is a read-only operation and that the logging strategy is sound before approval.*",
