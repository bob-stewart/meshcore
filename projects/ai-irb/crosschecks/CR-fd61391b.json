      "stance": "request_changes",
      "summary": "1) **RISK: MEDIUM**\n\n2) **CONCERNS:**\n*   **Audit Trail Pollution:** High frequency (hourly) \"warm-up\" transactions against the governance engine risk flooding compliance logs, making it difficult to distinguish between genuine safety violations and synthetic warm-up traffic.\n*   **Resource Contention:** There is a risk that the warm-up script could consume compute resources or lock database rows needed for real-time production governance checks, potentially introducing latency to safety enforcement.\n*   **Policy Integrity:** It is unclear if the \"dogfood\" script utilizes production policies or a test subset. If test policies are loaded into the production engine context for the warm-up, there is a risk of configuration drift or accidental policy override.\n*   **Failure Modes:** If the warm-up script fails (e.g., false positive violation), does it trigger a high-severity incident response (pager fatigue) or, worse, fail-open and disable the governance engine?\n\n3) **REQUIRED_GATES:**\n*   **Traffic Tagging Verification:** Evidence that all telemetry generated by this script is explicitly tagged (e.g., `is_synthetic=true` or `source=dogfood`) to ensure it can be filtered out of compliance audits.\n*   **Load Impact Analysis:** A comparison of governance engine latency during the script execution vs. baseline to ensure no degradation of service for production traffic.\n*   **Read-Only/No-Side-Effect Confirmation:** Confirmation that the warm-up routine is strictly verifying logic paths and caching, and not altering state or writing to the governance policy store.\n*   **Alerting Threshold Review:** Proof that alerts generated by this specific script are routed to a low-urgency queue or suppressed entirely to prevent on-call fatigue.\n\n4) **RECOMMENDATION: REQUEST_CHANGES**\n\n**Reasoning:** While keeping the governance engine \"warm\" (caching) is a valid operational goal, touching the governance surface requires strict isolation of test data from audit data. We cannot approve until we see explicit evidence that this hourly traffic will not degrade the signal-to-noise ratio of our safety compliance logs.",
