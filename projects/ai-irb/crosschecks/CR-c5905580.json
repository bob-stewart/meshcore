      "summary": "1) RISK: **MEDIUM**\n\n2) CONCERNS:\n*   **Audit Log Pollution:** There is a significant risk that synthetic \"warm-up\" traffic will be commingled with actual governance enforcement logs, compromising the integrity of compliance audits and safety reviews.\n*   **Resource Contention:** Without explicit throttling, an hourly burst of requests could momentarily lock resources or consume rate limits required for live inference traffic, potentially causing latency in safety checks.\n*   **State Mutation:** It is unclear if the \"warm-up\" is strictly read-only. If the script initializes state, caches, or counters, it could introduce \"ghost\" data that affects subsequent governance decisions.\n*   **Alert Fatigue:** If the warm-up involves simulating policy violations to test the engine, it risks triggering false positive security alerts, desensitizing the Ops team to real threats.\n\n3) REQUIRED_GATES:\n*   **Traffic Segregation:** Evidence that all requests generated by this script are tagged (e.g., specific headers or user agents) and explicitly filtered out of production compliance/audit reporting pipelines.\n*   **Immutability Verification:** Static analysis or trace logs confirming that the script performs `READ` operations only and executes no state-mutating transactions on the governance policy store.\n*   **Load Impact Analysis:** Metrics from a staging run showing the script consumes negligible resources (<1% CPU/Memory) and does not increase latency for concurrent \"real\" governance requests.\n*   **Failure Mode Safety:** Documentation proving that if the ops-script hangs or crashes, it does not block the governance engine or degrade the availability of the inference path (fail-open/fail-safe check).\n\n4) RECOMMENDATION: **REQUEST_CHANGES**",
