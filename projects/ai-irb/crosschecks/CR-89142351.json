      "summary": "1) RISK: **MEDIUM**\n\n2) CONCERNS:\n*   **Audit Log Pollution:** High frequency (hourly) synthetic traffic mixed with real governance decisions compromises the integrity of compliance logs and makes forensic analysis difficult.\n*   **Alert Fatigue:** If the \"dogfood\" scenario triggers policy violations to test the engine, it risks paging on-call engineers for false positives, desensitizing them to real safety incidents.\n*   **State Mutation Risk:** The term \"warm-up\" is ambiguous. If this script modifies state (e.g., creating temporary policies or user sessions) and fails to clean up, it could leave the governance engine in an inconsistent or insecure state.\n*   **Resource Contention:** Running heavy governance logic hourly could degrade latency for actual user requests if not properly prioritized/throttled.\n*   **Privilege Scope:** The script likely requires elevated permissions to interact with the governance engine. If the script is compromised, it becomes a vector to bypass or alter safety guardrails.\n\n3) REQUIRED_GATES:\n*   **Synthetic Traffic Tagging:** Evidence that all requests generated by this script are explicitly tagged (e.g., `is_synthetic=true`, `source=dogfood`) to allow for easy filtering in audit logs and metrics.\n*   **Read-Only/Idempotency Verification:** Code review confirmation that the \"warm-up\" routine is strictly read-only or idempotent and does not alter active safety policies.\n*   **Alert Suppression Validation:** Demonstration that expected policy violations triggered by this script are routed to a separate notification channel (or suppressed) and do not trigger P0/P1 incident response workflows.\n*   **Failure Mode Analysis:** Documentation of behavior if the governance engine is unreachable. The script must fail gracefully without blocking production traffic or causing a \"fail-open\" scenario.\n*   **Credential Isolation:** Confirmation that the script uses a dedicated service account with the principle of least privilege, specifically unable to *administer* the governance engine, only *invoke* it.\n\n4) RECOMMENDATION: **REQUEST_CHANGES**",
