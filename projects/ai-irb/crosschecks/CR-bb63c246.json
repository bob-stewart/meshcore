      "summary": "1) RISK: **MEDIUM**\n\n2) CONCERNS:\n*   **Audit Log Pollution:** The Governance engine is a critical compliance component. Injecting hourly synthetic traffic (\"dogfood\") risks contaminating audit trails, making it difficult to distinguish between real policy violations and test artifacts during a forensic review.\n*   **Privilege Escalation/Scope:** It is unclear if the warm-up script requires write access or administrative privileges to function. Over-privileged ops scripts represent a significant security vector.\n*   **Production Stability:** If the \"dogfood\" version of the governance rules/engine is unstable (which is the nature of dogfooding), running it hourly against production infrastructure could cause cascading failures or latency spikes for legitimate traffic.\n*   **Alert Fatigue:** If the warm-up fails due to transient dogfood issues, it may trigger high-severity alerts, desensitizing on-call engineers to actual governance failures.\n\n3) REQUIRED_GATES:\n*   **Data Segregation Plan:** Evidence that all logs, metrics, and audit entries generated by this script are explicitly tagged (e.g., `is_synthetic=true`, `source=dogfood`) to ensure they can be filtered out of compliance reports.\n*   **Least Privilege Verification:** Confirmation that the service account executing the script possesses the minimum permissions necessary (ideally Read-Only) and cannot alter production governance policies.\n*   **Resource Impact Analysis:** A load test result showing that the \"warm-up\" process does not consume more than 1% of available CPU/Memory or degrade P99 latency for concurrent real-time governance checks.\n*   **Failure Mode Documentation:** A defined playbook for how the system handles a script failure (e.g., \"fail open\" vs. \"fail closed\") and confirmation that it does not block production operations.\n\n4) RECOMMENDATION: **REQUEST_CHANGES**",
