      "summary": "1) **RISK: MEDIUM**\n\n2) **CONCERNS:**\n*   **Audit Log Pollution:** There is a risk that synthetic \"warm-up\" traffic will be commingled with real user traffic in safety audit logs, making ex-post-facto safety analysis and defensibility difficult.\n*   **State Mutation:** If the governance engine maintains state (e.g., rate limiting, rolling windows for abuse detection), hourly warm-up requests might inadvertently increment counters or skew usage metrics.\n*   **Alert Fatigue:** If the warm-up script fails (e.g., network blip), it may trigger high-severity governance failure alerts, desensitizing the team to actual safety mechanism failures.\n*   **Payload Safety:** The specific payload used for the warm-up is unknown. If the payload contains adversarial content to \"test\" the filter, it must be handled differently than a neutral \"ping\" to avoid flagging internal accounts as malicious.\n\n3) **REQUIRED_GATES:**\n*   **Traffic Segregation Verification:** Evidence that the `ops-script` injects a specific header or metadata tag (e.g., `x-traffic-type: synthetic`) allowing the data pipeline to filter these requests out of safety compliance reports.\n*   **No-Op Confirmation:** Proof that the warm-up request follows a \"dry run\" path or does not mutate persistent state (quotas, reputation scores) within the governance engine.\n*   **Payload Review:** Disclosure of the specific prompt/input used in the warm-up script to ensure it does not trigger unintended policy violation workflows.\n*   **Failure Handling:** Documentation showing that a failure of the warm-up script results in a distinct operational warning, not a critical governance breach alert.\n\n4) **RECOMMENDATION: REQUEST_CHANGES**\n*   *Reasoning:* While warming up the engine is operationally sound, touching the `governance` surface requires strict data hygiene. Approval is withheld until a mechanism for segregating synthetic data from safety audit logs is explicitly defined and verified.",
