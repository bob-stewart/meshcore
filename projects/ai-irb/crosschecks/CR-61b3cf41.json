      "summary": "1) RISK: **MEDIUM**\n\n2) CONCERNS:\n*   **Metric Contamination:** Hourly dogfooding on the governance engine risks skewing production safety metrics (false positives/negatives) if the traffic is not explicitly tagged and filtered from analytics.\n*   **State Modification:** There is a risk that the \"warm-up\" routine might inadvertently update stateful components of the governance engine (e.g., rate limit counters, adaptive thresholds) rather than just reading/caching them.\n*   **Payload Safety:** The specific prompts/inputs used for the warm-up are unknown. If the script uses toxic or adversarial prompts to \"test\" the governance filters, there is a risk of these leaking into logs or training data if not properly sandboxed.\n*   **Resource Contention:** While \"hourly\" suggests low frequency, if the warm-up involves heavy inference or complex rule evaluation, it could introduce latency spikes for legitimate traffic during the run window.\n\n3) REQUIRED_GATES:\n*   **Traffic Isolation Verification:** Evidence that all requests generated by this script contain specific headers or metadata (e.g., `x-traffic-type: synthetic`) allowing them to be excluded from production safety reporting.\n*   **Payload Audit:** Review of the specific input data used in the script to ensure it does not contain PII or unflagged toxic content that could trigger severe alerts.\n*   **Read-Only Confirmation:** Confirmation that the script executes in a mode that does not increment user-facing rate limits or modify global governance policies.\n*   **Evidence Review (ID 20260218T221957Z):** Must verify that the referenced dry-run logs show zero impact on concurrent production latency and that the \"warm-up\" successfully exercised the intended paths without error.\n\n4) RECOMMENDATION: **REQUEST_CHANGES**\n\n*Reasoning: While operational hygiene (warming up engines) is standard, automating interactions with the Governance surface requires strict isolation guarantees. We need explicit confirmation that this traffic will not pollute safety metrics or trigger false operational alarms before approval.*",
