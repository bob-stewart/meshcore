      "summary": "1) RISK: **MEDIUM**\n\n2) CONCERNS:\n*   **State Mutation Risks:** \"Warm-up\" implies activity to prime caches or models. If the governance engine has write-access (e.g., auto-remediation, blocking users, updating policy weights), an hourly automated run introduces a risk of accidental enforcement actions against internal or production entities due to hallucination or script errors.\n*   **Telemetry Pollution:** High-frequency synthetic traffic (dogfooding) may skew safety metrics, making it difficult to distinguish between real adversarial attacks and internal testing noise in audit logs.\n*   **Resource Contention:** Hourly execution of heavy governance logic could compete with live inference traffic for GPU/compute resources during peak windows if not properly prioritized.\n*   **Alert Fatigue:** If the dogfooding inputs include adversarial examples to test the engine, they might trigger high-severity alerts to the Trust & Safety team, desensitizing them to real incidents.\n\n3) REQUIRED_GATES:\n*   **Side-Effect Isolation:** Evidence that the script runs in a `dry-run` mode or a sandboxed environment where it cannot trigger downstream enforcement actions (bans, blocks, config changes).\n*   **Data Segregation:** Confirmation that logs/metrics generated by this script are explicitly tagged (e.g., `source: synthetic-dogfood`) and excluded from production safety compliance reports.\n*   **Payload Review:** A manifest of the inputs used for the warm-up. If using adversarial prompts to test the governance engine, they must be static and approved; if using dynamic generation, bounds must be set.\n*   **Circuit Breaker:** Implementation of a kill-switch that prevents the script from running if production latency exceeds a defined threshold.\n\n4) RECOMMENDATION: **REQUEST_CHANGES**\n\n*Reasoning: While warming up the engine is standard for performance, automating interactions with the `governance` surface requires explicit proof that the script is \"read-only\" regarding enforcement actions and will not pollute the audit trail used for safety defensibility.*",
