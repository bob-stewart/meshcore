      "summary": "1) RISK: **MEDIUM**\n\n2) CONCERNS:\n*   **Audit Log Pollution:** There is a significant risk that \"dogfood\" or \"warm-up\" traffic will be commingled with production compliance logs. If the governance engine is used for legal or safety auditing, synthetic data must be strictly segregable.\n*   **False Positive Alerting:** If the warm-up routine simulates policy violations to test the engine, it may trigger high-severity alerts to the Trust & Safety or Security operations teams, causing alert fatigue.\n*   **Resource Contention:** An hourly spike in processing (warm-up) could momentarily degrade the latency of real-time safety checks for actual user traffic.\n*   **Configuration Drift:** There is a concern that the warm-up script might temporarily load a \"test\" policy configuration that could accidentally persist or override the production safety policies.\n\n3) REQUIRED_GATES:\n*   **Data Segregation Proof:** Evidence that all telemetry and logs generated by this script are tagged (e.g., `traffic_type=synthetic`) and are automatically filtered out of compliance/audit dashboards.\n*   **Alert Suppression Verification:** Confirmation that the specific signals generated by this warm-up routine are silenced in PagerDuty/OpsGenie to prevent on-call disruption.\n*   **Load/Latency Impact Report:** A comparison of governance engine latency during a manual run of the script vs. baseline to ensure no degradation of service for production traffic.\n*   **Fail-Safe Analysis:** Documentation on the script's behavior if the governance engine is down or slow (e.g., does the script retry indefinitely, potentially causing a DDoS on the internal service?).\n\n4) RECOMMENDATION: **REQUEST_CHANGES**\n\n*Reasoning: While operational maintenance is necessary, touching the governance surface requires strict hygiene regarding logs and alerts. The current summary does not provide evidence that synthetic traffic is isolated from legal/compliance audit trails.*",
