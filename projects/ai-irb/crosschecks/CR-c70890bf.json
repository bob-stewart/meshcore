      "summary": "1) **RISK:** MEDIUM\n\n2) **CONCERNS:**\n*   **Audit Log Pollution:** Governance engines typically maintain immutable logs of decisions/access checks. There is a risk that \"warm-up\" traffic will be indistinguishable from real traffic, corrupting compliance audits or usage metrics.\n*   **State Modification:** \"Warm-up\" implies activity to prime caches or connections. If this involves write operations (even temporary ones), there is a risk of unintended side effects or race conditions with legitimate governance policies.\n*   **Alert Fatigue:** If the dogfood script fails (e.g., due to network blips), it must be configured not to trigger high-severity PagerDuty alerts unless the Governance Engine itself is down.\n*   **Privilege Management:** The script requires authentication to interact with the Governance Engine. Storing or managing these credentials within `ops-scripts` introduces a potential attack vector if not handled via managed identities.\n\n3) **REQUIRED_GATES:**\n*   **Side-Effect Analysis:** Evidence that the script runs in a `dry-run` mode or against a segregated \"synthetic\" tenant/resource ID to prevent mixing test data with production governance records.\n*   **Telemetry Tagging:** Confirmation that requests from this script are explicitly tagged (e.g., `User-Agent: HealthCheck` or `X-Is-Synthetic: true`) so they can be filtered out of BI dashboards and compliance reports.\n*   **Service Account Review:** Verification that the identity running the script has the minimum necessary permissions (Least Privilege) and cannot alter governance policies, only read/evaluate them.\n*   **Resource Cap:** Confirmation that the script has timeouts and concurrency limits to prevent it from accidentally DDoS-ing the governance engine during the hourly run.\n\n4) **RECOMMENDATION:** REQUEST_CHANGES\n\n*Reasoning: While the intent (latency reduction/cache priming) is valid, touching the Governance surface requires strict proof that the \"dogfood\" data will not contaminate the audit trails used for legal or compliance defense. The current summary does not explain how the script isolates its activity from production data.*",
