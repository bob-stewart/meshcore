      "summary": "# AI-IRB Panel Assessment\n\n## SUMMARY REVIEW: Hourly dogfood — governance engine warm-up\n\nThis appears to be a recurring (hourly) self-test or \"dogfood\" exercise that warms up the governance engine, affecting ops-scripts and the governance surface itself.\n\n---\n\n## 1) RISK: **LOW**\n\nWarm-up / dogfood routines for governance engines are generally low-risk, as they exercise existing pathways rather than introducing new logic. However, the fact that this touches the governance surface itself warrants careful scrutiny — a malformed warm-up could, in theory, alter governance state or mask failures.\n\n---\n\n## 2) CONCERNS:\n\n- **Self-referential surface risk:** The governance engine is both the subject and the evaluator — any bug in warm-up could degrade the very system responsible for safety checks.\n- **State mutation:** Need to confirm warm-up is strictly read-only / idempotent and does not write governance decisions, alter policy state, or create audit artifacts that could be confused with real governance events.\n- **Failure mode ambiguity:** If the warm-up silently fails, operators may have false confidence that the governance engine is healthy (\"green dashboard, dead engine\" problem).\n- **Hourly cadence:** Frequency is reasonable but should be validated against resource contention — could warm-up crowd out or delay real governance evaluations under load?\n- **Single evidence artifact:** Only one evidence ID (`20260216T161956Z`) is provided. Limited evidence base for review.\n- **Observability:** Unclear whether warm-up results are logged, alerted on failure, and distinguishable from production governance invocations in audit trails.\n\n---\n\n## 3) REQUIRED_GATES:\n\n- **Idempotency verification:** Evidence that the warm-up routine makes no persistent state changes to governance configuration, policy, or decision logs.\n- **Isolation test:** Confirmation that warm-up invocations are tagged/labeled distinctly from production governance calls in all logging and audit systems.\n- **Failure alerting:** Demonstrated alerting pathway if warm-up fails (not just silent log entry).\n- **Load/contention analysis:** Evidence that hourly execution does not interfere with real-time governance evaluations, especially under peak load.\n- **Rollback path:** Documented procedure to disable the hourly warm-up without affecting governance engine availability.\n- **Dry-run in staging:** At least one full hourly cycle observed in a staging/pre-prod environment with logs reviewed before production deployment.\n- **Second evidence artifact or test report:** A single evidence ID is insufficient; request at least a test execution log and a review of the ops-script diff.\n\n---\n\n## 4) RECOMMENDATION: **REQUEST_CHANGES**\n\n### Rationale:\nThe concept is sound and the risk is low in principle, but the submission is under-evidenced. A governance-touching change — even a warm-up — requires clear demonstration of idempotency, observability, and failure-mode handling before approval. The single evidence ID does not provide sufficient basis to confirm these properties.\n\n**Provide the additional gates above and this should be straightforward to approve on re-review.**",
