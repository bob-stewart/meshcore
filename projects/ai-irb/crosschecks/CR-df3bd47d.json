      "summary": "1) **RISK:** MEDIUM\n\n2) **CONCERNS:**\n*   **State Contamination:** There is a risk that \"warming up\" the engine might load test/dogfood policies or configurations into the production cache, potentially overriding strict production safety rules with looser internal ones.\n*   **Audit Log Pollution:** High-frequency (hourly) dogfooding may flood safety and compliance logs, making it difficult to detect or investigate genuine adversarial attacks or failures.\n*   **Resource Contention:** If the warm-up script is resource-intensive, it could induce latency in the governance engine, causing timeouts for legitimate user traffic.\n*   **Alert Fatigue:** If the dogfood script fails (common in ops-scripts), it may trigger high-severity on-call alerts, desensitizing the team to actual governance failures.\n\n3) **REQUIRED_GATES:**\n*   **Isolation Verification:** Evidence that the script runs in a `dry-run` mode or uses a dedicated tenant ID that cannot affect the global state of the governance engine.\n*   **Telemetry Tagging:** Confirmation that all logs and metrics generated by this script are explicitly tagged (e.g., `source:synthetic` or `env:dogfood`) to ensure exclusion from compliance reporting.\n*   **Non-Blocking Execution:** Proof that the script runs asynchronously and that a failure or hang in the script does not block the critical path for incoming production requests.\n*   **Policy Integrity Check:** Verification that the script does not have write access to the policy store or the ability to flush/reload the policy cache.\n\n4) **RECOMMENDATION:** APPROVE\n*Conditional on the evidence (20260221T092331Z) confirming the script is read-only and telemetry is properly segmented.*",
