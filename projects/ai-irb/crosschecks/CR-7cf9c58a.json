      "summary": "1) **RISK: MEDIUM**\n\n2) **CONCERNS:**\n*   **Audit Log Pollution:** \"Dogfood\" traffic interacting with the governance engine risks polluting compliance logs and audit trails, making it difficult to distinguish between synthetic warm-up events and actual policy enforcement actions.\n*   **Resource Contention:** An hourly burst of traffic (warm-up) could trigger race conditions or consume rate limits/quotas intended for production traffic, potentially causing latency spikes or denial of service for legitimate users.\n*   **State Corruption:** If the governance engine maintains state (e.g., cumulative risk scores), synthetic traffic might inadvertently alter the risk profile of the test accounts or, worse, global counters.\n*   **Alert Fatigue:** Periodic spikes in governance activity may trigger false positive monitoring alerts, desensitizing on-call engineers to actual anomalies.\n\n3) **REQUIRED_GATES:**\n*   **Traffic Segmentation Evidence:** Demonstration that warm-up requests contain specific headers or metadata tags allowing them to be filtered out of compliance reporting and production analytics.\n*   **Non-Blocking Verification:** Load test results showing that the warm-up script executes at a priority level lower than production traffic or within a dedicated resource slice to prevent latency degradation.\n*   **Read-Only/Idempotency Check:** Confirmation that the script performs read-only operations or operates on ephemeral test objects, ensuring no permanent state changes to the governance database.\n*   **Failure Mode Analysis:** Documentation detailing what happens if the script hangs or fails (e.g., timeouts) to ensure it does not lock governance resources.\n\n4) **RECOMMENDATION: REQUEST_CHANGES**\n*   *Reasoning:* While warming up the engine is a valid operational improvement, touching the `governance` surface requires strict isolation guarantees. The current summary does not explicitly detail how audit logs will remain clean or how production quotas are protected from this hourly load. Please update the proposal to address the segmentation of synthetic data.",
