      "summary": "1) **RISK: MEDIUM**\n\n2) **CONCERNS:**\n*   **Audit Log Pollution:** There is a significant risk that hourly \"dogfood\" data will be commingled with production governance logs. This compromises the defensibility of audit trails and compliance reporting if not strictly tagged.\n*   **Operational Noise:** High-frequency automated checks against the governance engine may trigger false positive alerts for the security operations center (SOC) or on-call engineers if the \"warm-up\" simulates adversarial attacks.\n*   **Resource Contention:** Running hourly scripts against the governance surface could introduce latency for legitimate user requests if the engine does not prioritize production traffic over dogfooding traffic.\n*   **Failure Mode Behavior:** It is unclear how the system behaves if the warm-up fails. Does a failed warm-up interpret the governance engine as \"down\" and trigger a fail-closed (system lockout) scenario?\n\n3) **REQUIRED_GATES:**\n*   **Telemetry Isolation:** Evidence must be provided showing that all logs, metrics, and traces generated by this script are explicitly tagged (e.g., `traffic_type: synthetic` or `env: dogfood`) and excluded from compliance reporting.\n*   **Non-Blocking Failure Policy:** Verification that a failure of the `ops-script` does not degrade the availability of the governance engine for production users (i.e., the script must fail open or silently, not trigger a system-wide lockdown).\n*   **Load Impact Analysis:** A brief assessment showing that hourly execution does not consume shared rate limits or compute quotas reserved for production inference.\n*   **Alert Suppression:** Confirmation that the specific signatures used in the warm-up are whitelisted in the incident response alerting pipeline to prevent alert fatigue.\n\n4) **RECOMMENDATION: REQUEST_CHANGES**\n*   *Reasoning:* While keeping a governance engine \"warm\" (preventing cold starts) is operationally sound, touching the governance surface requires strict evidence that synthetic traffic cannot be mistaken for real user behavior or adversarial attacks in audit logs. Approval is withheld until telemetry isolation is confirmed.",
