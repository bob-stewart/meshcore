      "summary": "1) RISK: **MEDIUM**\n\n2) CONCERNS:\n*   **Audit Log Pollution:** Governance engines are critical for compliance and safety defensibility. Injecting hourly synthetic traffic risks polluting audit logs, making it difficult to distinguish between real policy violations and \"warm-up\" events during a forensic review.\n*   **Metric Skew:** If the warm-up traffic is not strictly segregated in telemetry, it may artificially inflate availability metrics or mask latency issues in the governance decision path.\n*   **Resource Contention:** While intended to \"warm up\" the engine, bursty hourly traffic could cause momentary latency spikes for legitimate user requests, potentially leading to timeouts in safety checks (fail-open or fail-closed risks).\n*   **Credential Management:** The script likely requires high-level privileges to invoke governance checks. If these credentials are hardcoded or loosely managed in `ops-scripts`, it expands the attack surface.\n\n3) REQUIRED_GATES:\n*   **Synthetic Data Tagging:** Evidence that all logs and metrics generated by this script are explicitly tagged (e.g., `traffic_type=synthetic` or `source=dogfood`) to ensure they can be filtered out of compliance audits.\n*   **Staging Load Test:** Results from a staging environment showing the impact of the warm-up script on concurrent \"real\" traffic latency.\n*   **Failure Mode Analysis:** Documentation of behavior if the governance engine is unreachable. The script must fail gracefully without retrying aggressively (to avoid self-DDoS) and alert the appropriate team without triggering a general SEV-1 incident.\n*   **Least Privilege Verification:** Confirmation that the service account used by the script has the minimum permissions necessary to trigger the warm-up, without administrative override capabilities.\n\n4) RECOMMENDATION: **REQUEST_CHANGES**\n\n*Rationale: While the intent to keep caches warm is valid, touching the governance engine requires strict data hygiene. We cannot approve until there is confirmation that this traffic will not degrade the defensibility of our safety logs or skew compliance metrics.*",
