      "summary": "1) RISK: **MEDIUM**\n\n2) CONCERNS:\n*   **Data Hygiene & Model Pollution:** There is a significant risk that synthetic \"dogfood\" data (prompts and completions used for warming up) will be ingested into production logs. If the governance engine uses production logs for future fine-tuning or few-shot examples, this synthetic data could bias or degrade future model performance.\n*   **Alert Fatigue:** If the warm-up routine includes adversarial prompts to test the governance boundaries, it may trigger false-positive safety alerts to human review teams, leading to desensitization.\n*   **Resource Contention:** Hourly execution against the governance engine—depending on the complexity of the checks—could introduce latency spikes for legitimate production traffic if not properly rate-limited or prioritized lower than user requests.\n*   **Security Surface:** An automated script with permissions to invoke the governance engine creates a new attack vector. If the script is modified by an attacker, it could be used to \"map\" the governance boundaries (model extraction/inversion) without being rate-limited as an external user would be.\n\n3) REQUIRED_GATES:\n*   **Data Segregation Verification:** Evidence that all logs, metrics, and data artifacts generated by this script are tagged (e.g., `is_synthetic=true`, `env=dogfood`) and explicitly excluded from future training pipelines and safety reporting dashboards.\n*   **Alert Suppression Test:** A dry run demonstrating that \"unsafe\" inputs used during the warm-up do not trigger PagerDuty or high-priority tickets for the Trust & Safety team.\n*   **Resource Impact Analysis:** A comparison of governance engine latency during a warm-up run vs. baseline to ensure no degradation of user experience.\n*   **Identity & Access Control:** Confirmation that the script runs with a service account that has *invoke-only* permissions and cannot modify governance policies or configurations.\n\n4) RECOMMENDATION: **REQUEST_CHANGES**\n\n*Rationale: While operational maintenance is necessary, automating interactions with the governance layer requires strict data hygiene guarantees to prevent model pollution and operational noise. Approval is withheld until data segregation and alert suppression are confirmed.*",
