      "summary": "1) RISK: **MEDIUM**\n\n2) CONCERNS:\n*   **Audit Trail Pollution:** High-frequency (hourly) dogfooding on the governance engine risks flooding safety logs and audit trails with synthetic data, making post-incident forensics for real safety violations difficult.\n*   **Production Latency:** \"Warming up\" implies generating load. There is a risk that the warm-up script could contend for resources with live traffic, introducing latency to actual safety checks.\n*   **Alert Fatigue:** If the dogfood inputs are designed to trigger governance violations (to test enforcement), they may trigger high-severity alerts to the on-call team, leading to desensitization.\n*   **State Corruption:** If the governance engine maintains stateful counters (e.g., rate limiting, abuse tracking), synthetic traffic could artificially inflate these counters, blocking legitimate users.\n\n3) REQUIRED_GATES:\n*   **Data Segregation Verification:** Evidence that all telemetry, logs, and audit records generated by this script are explicitly tagged (e.g., `source:synthetic` or `tenant:dogfood`) and excluded from standard compliance reporting.\n*   **Non-Blocking Execution Proof:** Load test results demonstrating that the warm-up script runs asynchronously and yields priority to production traffic immediately upon contention.\n*   **Alert Suppression Configuration:** Confirmation that the monitoring system is configured to suppress or route alerts triggered by this specific dogfood user/script to a separate, non-critical channel.\n*   **State Isolation Test:** Verification that the script does not increment global abuse counters or affect rate limits for other tenants.\n\n4) RECOMMENDATION: **REQUEST_CHANGES**\n\n*Rationale: While warming up the engine is operationally sound, touching the governance layer requires strict hygiene to ensure we do not blind ourselves to real safety incidents or degrade the performance of safety checks. The current summary does not detail how audit pollution and alert fatigue are mitigated.*",
