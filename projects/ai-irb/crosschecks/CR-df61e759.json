      "summary": "1) **RISK:** MEDIUM\n\n2) **CONCERNS:**\n*   **Audit Log Pollution:** There is a significant risk that \"warm-up\" traffic (synthetic queries) will be commingled with actual user traffic in governance logs. This compromises the integrity of compliance audits and safety reviews.\n*   **Resource Contention:** If the governance engine is under load, an automated hourly script could exacerbate latency for real-time safety checks on user prompts.\n*   **Alert Fatigue:** If the warm-up script utilizes adversarial prompts to test the engine's responsiveness, it may trigger false positive alerts for the Trust & Safety team.\n*   **Privilege Scope:** The script requires access to the governance layer; if the script's credentials are over-privileged, it introduces a new attack surface.\n\n3) **REQUIRED_GATES:**\n*   **Traffic Tagging/Isolation:** Evidence that all requests generated by this script include specific metadata headers (e.g., `X-Traffic-Type: Synthetic-Warmup`) to ensure they can be filtered out of compliance reporting and safety metrics.\n*   **Priority Throttling:** Configuration proof that the script runs at a lower priority than user traffic and has a timeout/back-off mechanism if the governance engine reports high latency.\n*   **Alert Suppression Verification:** Confirmation that the specific payloads used in the warm-up are whitelisted in the alerting system to prevent paging on-call engineers.\n*   **Read-Only Verification:** Confirmation that the script performs inference/checks only and has no write access to modify governance policies or configurations.\n\n4) **RECOMMENDATION:** REQUEST_CHANGES\n\n*Reasoning: While operational maintenance is necessary, touching the governance engine requires strict separation of synthetic and organic data. We cannot approve until we see explicit evidence of how the logs will be segregated to prevent audit contamination.*",
