      "summary": "1) **RISK:** MEDIUM\n\n2) **CONCERNS:**\n*   **Audit Log Pollution:** Introducing synthetic traffic into the `governance` engine risks contaminating compliance logs. If \"warm-up\" data is not strictly segregated or tagged, it compromises the defensibility of audit trails.\n*   **Production Interference:** There is a risk that the warm-up script could consume rate limits, lock database rows, or increase latency for legitimate user traffic during execution.\n*   **Privilege Management:** `ops-scripts` often require elevated permissions. There is a concern regarding how this script authenticates with the governance engine and whether it adheres to the principle of least privilege.\n*   **Alert Fatigue/False Positives:** If the warm-up script fails (e.g., due to a network blip), it may trigger high-severity alerts for the governance team, leading to desensitization to real incidents.\n\n3) **REQUIRED_GATES:**\n*   **Traffic Tagging Verification:** Evidence that all requests generated by this script include a specific header or metadata tag (e.g., `X-Traffic-Type: Synthetic`) to allow for filtering in analytics and compliance audits.\n*   **Idempotency/Read-Only Proof:** Code review or test results confirming that the warm-up routine does not mutate state (e.g., it must not alter policies, ban users, or approve/deny real pending requests).\n*   **Resource Impact Analysis:** A benchmark showing the script's resource consumption (CPU/Memory/Latency) is negligible compared to total capacity.\n*   **Failure Mode Documentation:** A clear specification of what happens if the warm-up fails. (It must *not* disable the governance engine or cause it to fail open).\n\n4) **RECOMMENDATION:** REQUEST_CHANGES\n\n*Reasoning: While keeping the governance engine warm is a valid operational goal to reduce cold-start latency, touching the governance surface requires strict hygiene regarding logs and state. The current summary lacks details on how synthetic data is handled to prevent audit corruption.*",
