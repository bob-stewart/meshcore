      "summary": "1) RISK: LOW  \n2) CONCERNS:  \n   - Minimal operational impact expected from hourly internal dogfooding, but unthrottled runs could accumulate resource usage (CPU/memory) over time.  \n   - Governance engine \"warm-up\" must be strictly isolated to dogfood/test environments to avoid accidental policy enforcement in production.  \n   - Lack of detail on failure modes (e.g., what happens if warm-up fails repeatedly?).  \n   - EVIDENCE_IDS referenced but not described; assumes benign but requires validation.  \n\n3) REQUIRED_GATES:  \n   - Review EVIDENCE_IDS (20260224T162004Z) for logs/metrics showing successful runs, resource usage <5% avg, and no cross-environment bleed.  \n   - Confirm script isolation: grep/search ops-scripts/governance for prod/prod-like env vars or triggers; require explicit dogfood-only flags.  \n   - Run 24h simulation in staging: monitor for error rates, latency spikes, and alert thresholds.  \n   - Add monitoring/alerts for run failures (>3 consecutive) and resource caps (e.g., via Prometheus/Grafana).  \n\n4) RECOMMENDATION: REQUEST_CHANGES",

      "summary": "1) RISK: **MEDIUM**\n\n2) CONCERNS:\n*   **Audit Trail Pollution:** The governance engine is a critical compliance surface. Injecting hourly synthetic/dogfood traffic risks polluting production audit logs, making forensic analysis or compliance reporting difficult.\n*   **Resource Contention:** If the governance engine shares resources (compute, rate limits) with production traffic, an automated hourly script could introduce latency or throttling for legitimate user requests.\n*   **Failure Mode Ambiguity:** It is unclear how the system behaves if the \"warm-up\" fails. Does a failure in the dogfood script trigger a critical alert (indicating the governance engine is down), or is it ignored?\n*   **Data Privacy in Payloads:** \"Dogfooding\" implies using internal data. There is a risk that the payload used for the warm-up contains PII or sensitive internal data that should not be traversing the governance pipeline unnecessarily.\n\n3) REQUIRED_GATES:\n*   **Log Segmentation Verification:** Evidence that all traffic generated by this script is explicitly tagged (e.g., `traffic_type=synthetic` or `source=dogfood`) and can be 100% filtered out of compliance/audit reports.\n*   **Payload Safety Review:** Confirmation that the input data used for the warm-up is synthetic or sanitized, containing no real PII or sensitive IP.\n*   **Load/Latency Impact Analysis:** Metrics demonstrating that the execution of this script does not increase P99 latency for concurrent production requests.\n*   **Service Account Isolation:** Confirmation that the script runs under a dedicated service account with least-privilege access, rather than using shared admin credentials.\n\n4) RECOMMENDATION: **REQUEST_CHANGES**\n\n*Reasoning: While keeping the governance engine warm is operationally sound, modifying the traffic flow to a safety-critical component requires proof that compliance data will remain pristine and that the automation cannot degrade production performance.*",
