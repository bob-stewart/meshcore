      "summary": "1) RISK: **MEDIUM**\n\n2) CONCERNS:\n*   **Audit Log Pollution:** High-frequency (hourly) synthetic traffic through the governance engine risks burying legitimate security alerts or policy violation logs, making post-incident forensics difficult.\n*   **Recursive Enforcement Loops:** Since the script runs within `ops-scripts` but targets `governance`, there is a risk of infinite recursion if the governance engine attempts to govern the warm-up script itself (e.g., blocking the script, which retries, creating a denial-of-service).\n*   **State Corruption:** The term \"warm-up\" is ambiguous. If this involves writing dummy data or toggling policy states to ensure responsiveness, it could accidentally leave the governance engine in a restrictive or open state.\n*   **Resource Contention:** Artificial load on the governance layer every hour could introduce latency for legitimate user queries during the execution window.\n\n3) REQUIRED_GATES:\n*   **Synthetic Data Tagging:** Evidence that all telemetry, logs, and audit trails generated by this script are explicitly tagged (e.g., `is_synthetic=true` or `source=dogfood`) to ensure they can be filtered out during security audits.\n*   **Read-Only / No-Op Verification:** Code review or test results confirming the warm-up routine is strictly read-only or idempotent and cannot alter active policy configurations.\n*   **Circuit Breaker Implementation:** Proof that the script has a hard timeout and will fail silently (without retrying aggressively) if the governance engine is under heavy load or down.\n*   **Alert Suppression Validation:** Confirmation that the specific signals generated by this warm-up will not trigger high-severity security pages/alerts to the on-call team.\n\n4) RECOMMENDATION: **REQUEST_CHANGES**\n\n*Reasoning: While keeping the governance engine warm is operationally sound, modifying the behavior of the primary safety enforcement layer requires strict evidence that the \"noise\" generated will not blind us to actual signals. The current summary lacks detail on how the logs are segregated and what specific operations constitute the \"warm-up.\"*",
