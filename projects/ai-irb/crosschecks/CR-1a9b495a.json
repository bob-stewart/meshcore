      "summary": "1) **RISK: MEDIUM**\n\n2) **CONCERNS:**\n- **Privilege/scope ambiguity:** “governance engine warm-up” could invoke sensitive governance paths (policy evaluation, access checks, audit pipelines) with elevated credentials; unclear if strictly read-only and side-effect-free.\n- **Unintended side effects:** Warm-up tasks sometimes populate caches, precompute decisions, or touch persistent stores; could accidentally **mutate state** (e.g., cache poisoning, policy snapshot writes, metrics/audit spam).\n- **Operational blast radius:** Hourly execution via `ops-scripts` can become a **reliability amplifier** (thundering herd on the hour, retries, lock contention) and create correlated load spikes.\n- **Failure modes / alert noise:** If the warm-up fails hourly, it can create paging noise or mask real incidents; unclear handling for partial outages and backoff.\n- **Security/audit implications:** Governance surfaces often require strict auditability; warm-up may generate **non-human “access” events** that dilute audit signal unless clearly labeled and segregated.\n- **Change defensibility:** Evidence is referenced only by ID; no visible artifacts here to establish that the warm-up is safe, idempotent, and constrained.\n\n3) **REQUIRED_GATES:**\n- **Design/behavior spec** demonstrating:\n  - Exactly what endpoints/functions are called, with explicit statement of **no persistent writes** (or enumerated/justified writes).\n  - Idempotency guarantees and concurrency behavior (e.g., locking, dedupe, single-flight).\n- **Access control proof:**\n  - Dedicated service identity with **least privilege** (only what warm-up needs).\n  - Credential storage/rotation documented; no reuse of broad ops credentials.\n- **Load & reliability validation:**\n  - Staging soak test covering at least **24–72 hours** of hourly runs.\n  - Load test showing acceptable CPU/memory/DB impact and no top-of-hour contention; include retry/backoff strategy.\n- **Observability requirements:**\n  - Metrics (success/failure, duration, downstream error rates), structured logs, and tracing.\n  - Alerting that is **actionable** (e.g., alert only after N consecutive failures) and runbook links.\n- **Audit/log hygiene:**\n  - Warm-up actions tagged as “system warm-up” in audit trails; confirm it doesn’t generate misleading “access granted/denied” events without context.\n- **Deployment safety:**\n  - Canary rollout (subset of environments/tenants) + clear rollback plan.\n  - Feature flag or config toggle to disable quickly without redeploy.\n- **Code review + security review evidence** tied to **EVIDENCE_IDS: 20260217T151958Z** (diff, reviewer list, test results, and approval record).\n\n4) **RECOMMENDATION: REQUEST_CHANGES**",

      "summary": "1) RISK: **LOW**\n\n2) CONCERNS:\n*   **Audit Trail Contamination:** There is a risk that \"dogfood\" (synthetic) traffic will be commingled with production user traffic in governance logs. This compromises the defensibility of our safety metrics and compliance reporting (e.g., inflating false positive rates or masking real abuse trends).\n*   **Adversarial Prompt Storage:** If the warm-up routine uses toxic or adversarial prompts to verify the governance engine is blocking correctly, these prompts must be stored and transmitted securely. Storing prohibited content in plain text `ops-scripts` repositories creates a compliance liability.\n*   **Alert Fatigue:** If the warm-up script fails (e.g., the governance engine is down), it must be distinguished from a security breach or a model collapse to prevent unnecessary paging of on-call safety engineers.\n\n3) REQUIRED_GATES:\n*   **Telemetry Segregation:** Evidence that all requests generated by this script include a distinct metadata tag (e.g., `traffic_type: synthetic-warmup`) to ensure they are automatically filtered out of high-level safety reporting and compliance audits.\n*   **Prompt Review:** A review of the specific inputs used for the warm-up. If they include policy-violating content (to test filters), they must be referenced via ID or secure storage, not hardcoded in the script.\n*   **Resource Prioritization:** Confirmation that these hourly jobs run at a lower priority than user traffic to prevent latency spikes during the governance check.\n\n4) RECOMMENDATION: **REQUEST_CHANGES**\n\n*Reasoning: While the operational risk is low, the defensibility risk is non-zero. We cannot approve a governance-related script without explicit confirmation that the synthetic data it generates will be rigorously segregated from actual user safety data.*",
