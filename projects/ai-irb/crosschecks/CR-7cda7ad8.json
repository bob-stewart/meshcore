      "summary": "# AI-IRB Panel Assessment\n\n## Summary Review\n\nThe proposal describes an \"hourly loop test\" targeting a \"backlog artifact\" across multiple operational surfaces. The summary is notably terse and lacks specificity about what is actually being changed, tested, or deployed.\n\n---\n\n## 1) RISK: **MEDIUM**\n\n---\n\n## 2) CONCERNS:\n\n- **Insufficient description**: \"Hourly loop test: backlog artifact\" does not explain what the test does, what the backlog artifact is, what behavior is being introduced or modified, or what the expected outcome is. This alone is a procedural red flag.\n- **Broad surface area**: The change touches four distinct surfaces (ops-scripts, sentinel, crosscheck, receipts), which suggests non-trivial scope despite the casual framing as a \"test.\"\n- **Sentinel and crosscheck involvement**: These are safety-critical monitoring surfaces. Any change to sentinel or crosscheck logic—even in a \"test\" capacity—could degrade oversight fidelity or create blind spots.\n- **Receipts surface**: Modifications to receipts could affect auditability and traceability of actions, which is a governance-critical function.\n- **\"Hourly loop\" pattern**: Recurring automated execution increases blast radius if the change contains errors or unintended side effects. A defect compounds 24x/day.\n- **Single evidence artifact**: Only one evidence ID is provided (20260216T033851Z). It is unclear whether this constitutes a test plan, a test result, a design document, or something else. The date also appears to be in the future (2026), which raises questions about provenance.\n- **No rollback plan described**: No mention of how to halt or revert if the loop test produces adverse effects.\n\n---\n\n## 3) REQUIRED_GATES:\n\n- **Expanded change description**: A clear, plain-language explanation of what the hourly loop test does, what the \"backlog artifact\" is, and what constitutes success/failure.\n- **Scope justification**: Rationale for why all four surfaces are affected and confirmation that changes to sentinel/crosscheck are read-only or otherwise non-degrading to safety monitoring.\n- **Evidence review**: The referenced evidence (20260216T033851Z) must be made available for panel inspection with clear labeling of what it demonstrates.\n- **Blast radius analysis**: Documentation of worst-case failure modes for a recurring hourly execution, including cascading effects across the four surfaces.\n- **Rollback / kill-switch mechanism**: A documented, tested mechanism to halt the loop and revert any state changes within one cycle.\n- **Dry-run results**: At least one successful dry-run execution with logged outputs reviewed by a human operator before recurring automation is enabled.\n- **Monitoring and alerting**: Confirmation that anomalous behavior in any of the four surfaces during loop execution will trigger alerts to a human reviewer.\n- **Time-boxed approval**: If approved, the loop test should have a defined expiration (e.g., 72 hours) after which it auto-disables and requires re-review.\n\n---\n\n## 4) RECOMMENDATION: **REQUEST_CHANGES**\n\n**Rationale**: The proposal as submitted does not meet the minimum evidentiary and descriptive standards for a change touching safety-critical surfaces. The terse summary, broad scope, single evidence artifact, and lack of rollback planning are collectively disqualifying in the current form. This is not a rejection of the concept—it is a request for the proposer to provide sufficient detail for the panel to make an informed safety determination. The involvement of sentinel and crosscheck surfaces elevates this beyond a routine ops-script change and demands proportionate rigor.",
