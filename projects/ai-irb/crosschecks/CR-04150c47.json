      "summary": "1) **RISK:** MEDIUM\n\n2) **CONCERNS:**\n*   **Resource Contention:** Automated hourly execution on the governance engine risks creating resource spikes (CPU, memory, database locks) that could paradoxically increase latency or cause timeouts for legitimate safety checks during the \"warm-up\" window.\n*   **Audit Log Pollution:** Synthetic traffic generated by the warm-up script may flood security logs, degrading the signal-to-noise ratio for auditors and potentially masking real governance violations.\n*   **Failure Mode Behavior:** If the warm-up script crashes or hangs, there is a risk it could leave the governance engine in an inconsistent state or hold locks on critical policy tables, leading to a \"fail-open\" (unsafe) or \"fail-closed\" (DoS) scenario.\n*   **Privilege Scope:** The script presumably requires permissions to invoke governance checks. If the service account used is over-privileged, it introduces a new attack surface for lateral movement within the ops environment.\n\n3) **REQUIRED_GATES:**\n*   **Resource Impact Analysis:** Telemetry evidence showing the script's impact on the governance engine's latency and throughput during peak and off-peak hours.\n*   **Synthetic Data Tagging:** Verification that all logs, traces, and audit entries generated by this script are explicitly tagged (e.g., `source:synthetic` or `test:warmup`) to ensure they are filterable in security dashboards.\n*   **Timeout & Circuit Breaking:** Evidence of hard timeouts in the script to ensure it cannot hang indefinitely or consume resources if the governance engine is unresponsive.\n*   **Least Privilege Validation:** Documentation confirming the script runs with a service account restricted strictly to *read/execute* permissions necessary for the warm-up, with no ability to modify governance policies.\n\n4) **RECOMMENDATION:** REQUEST_CHANGES",
