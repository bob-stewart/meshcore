      "summary": "1) **RISK: MEDIUM**\n\n2) **CONCERNS:**\n*   **Data Contamination (Training):** There is a risk that the \"dogfood\" inputs used to warm up the governance engine (especially if they include adversarial or borderline content to test detection) will be logged and inadvertently swept into future fine-tuning datasets, degrading model safety alignment.\n*   **Metric Skewing:** Hourly synthetic traffic may distort operational safety metrics (e.g., False Positive/Negative rates, total volume, latency averages), making it harder to detect real-world anomalies.\n*   **Alert Fatigue:** If the warm-up routine triggers safety violations to verify the engine is working, it risks generating \"boy who cried wolf\" scenarios for the Trust & Safety on-call team.\n*   **Production Latency:** Running scripts against the live governance engine creates a potential for resource contention, potentially slowing down safety checks for actual user traffic.\n*   **Ambiguity of \"Warm-up\":** The summary does not specify if this is a \"keep-alive\" ping (low risk) or a functional integration test using toxic payloads (higher risk).\n\n3) **REQUIRED_GATES:**\n*   **Payload Disclosure:** Must provide the exact JSON payloads/prompts being used for the hourly warm-up. If toxic content is used, strict isolation protocols are required.\n*   **Data Tagging/Exclusion Plan:** Evidence that all logs generated by this script are tagged (e.g., `is_synthetic=true`, `source=dogfood`) and explicitly excluded from training data pipelines and production safety dashboards.\n*   **Alert Suppression Verification:** Confirmation that the monitoring system is configured to ignore signals from this specific `ops-script` source ID to prevent paging human reviewers.\n*   **Resource Impact Analysis:** A brief load test result showing that the hourly execution does not increase P99 latency for concurrent user requests.\n\n4) **RECOMMENDATION: REQUEST_CHANGES**\n\n*Reasoning: While operational hygiene (warming up engines) is standard, the Governance Engine is a critical safety control. We cannot approve automated interactions with this surface without explicit confirmation that the synthetic data will not pollute safety logs or training sets.*",
