# MeshCORE

MeshCORE is an **agent-agnostic continuity layer**: decisions, state, and evidence pointers that survive LLM compaction, restarts, and model swaps.

## Layers
- **MeshCORE**: the shared contract + storage layout
- **SoftShell**: curated durable memory notes built on MeshCORE
- **HardShell**: environment + operations layer that generates evidence bundles and runs services
